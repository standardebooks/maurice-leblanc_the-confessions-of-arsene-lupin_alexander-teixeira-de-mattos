<h3 class="chapter2">TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS REWARD!...</h3>
<p>"Lupin," I said, "tell me something about yourself."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1" name="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, what would you have me tell you? Everybody
knows my life!" replied Lupin, who lay drowsing
on the sofa in my study.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows it!" I protested. "People know
from your letters in the newspapers that you were
mixed up in this case, that you started that case.
But the part which you played in it all, the plain facts
of the story, the upshot of the mystery: these are
things of which they know nothing."</p>
<p>"Pooh! A heap of uninteresting twaddle!"</p>
<p>"What! Your present of fifty thousand francs
to Nicolas Dugrival's wife! Do you call that uninteresting?
And what about the way in which you
solved the puzzle of the three pictures?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2" name="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Lupin laughed:</p>
<p>"Yes, that was a queer puzzle, certainly. I can
suggest a title for you if you like: what do you say
to <i>The Sign of the Shadow</i>?"</p>
<p>"And your successes in society and with the fair
sex?" I continued. "The dashing Arsène's love-affairs!...
And the clue to your good actions?
Those chapters in your life to which you have so
often alluded under the names of <i>The Wedding-ring</i>,
<i>Shadowed by Death</i>, and so on!... Why
delay these confidences and confessions, my dear
Lupin?... Come, do what I ask you!..."</p>
<p>It was at the time when Lupin, though already
famous, had not yet fought his biggest battles; the
time that preceded the great adventures of <i>The
Hollow Needle</i> and <i>813</i>. He had not yet dreamt
of annexing the accumulated treasures of the French
Royal House<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> nor of changing the map of Europe
under the Kaiser's nose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a>: he contented himself with
milder surprises and humbler profits, making his
daily effort, doing evil from day to day and doing
a little good as well, naturally and for the love of
the thing, like a whimsical and compassionate Don
Quixote.</p>
<p>He was silent; and I insisted:</p>
<p>"Lupin, I wish you would!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3" name="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>To my astonishment, he replied:</p>
<p>"Take a sheet of paper, old fellow, and a pencil."</p>
<p>I obeyed with alacrity, delighted at the thought
that he at last meant to dictate to me some of those
pages which he knows how to clothe with such
vigour and fancy, pages which I, unfortunately,
am obliged to spoil with tedious explanations and
boring developments.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Quite."</p>
<p>"Write down, 20, 1, 11, 5, 14, 15."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Write it down, I tell you."</p>
<p>He was now sitting up, with his eyes turned to
the open window and his fingers rolling a Turkish
cigarette. He continued:</p>
<p>"Write down, 21, 14, 14, 5...."</p>
<p>He stopped. Then he went on:</p>
<p>"3, 5, 19, 19 ..."</p>
<p>And, after a pause:</p>
<p>"5, 18, 25 ..."</p>
<p>Was he mad? I looked at him hard and,
presently, I saw that his eyes were no longer listless,
as they had been a little before, but keen and attentive
and that they seemed to be watching, somewhere,
in space, a sight that apparently captivated
them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4" name="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, he dictated, with intervals between
each number:</p>
<p>"18, 9, 19, 11, 19 ..."</p>
<p>There was hardly anything to be seen through the
window but a patch of blue sky on the right and
the front of the building opposite, an old private
house, whose shutters were closed as usual. There
was nothing particular about all this, no detail that
struck me as new among those which I had had before
my eyes for years....</p>
<p>"1, 2...."</p>
<p>And suddenly I understood ... or rather I
thought I understood, for how could I admit that
Lupin, a man so essentially level-headed under his
mask of frivolity, could waste his time upon such
childish nonsense? What he was counting was the
intermittent flashes of a ray of sunlight playing
on the dingy front of the opposite house, at the height
of the second floor!</p>
<p>"15, 22 ..." said Lupin.</p>
<p>The flash disappeared for a few seconds and then
struck the house again, successively, at regular
intervals, and disappeared once more.</p>
<p>I had instinctively counted the flashes and I
said, aloud:</p>
<p>"5...."</p>
<p>"Caught the idea? I congratulate you!" he
replied, sarcastically.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5" name="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>He went to the window and leant out, as though
to discover the exact direction followed by the
ray of light. Then he came and lay on the sofa again,
saying:</p>
<p>"It's your turn now. Count away!"</p>
<p>The fellow seemed so positive that I did as he told
me. Besides, I could not help confessing that there
was something rather curious about the ordered frequency
of those gleams on the front of the house
opposite, those appearances and disappearances,
turn and turn about, like so many flash signals.</p>
<p>They obviously came from a house on our side
of the street, for the sun was entering my windows
slantwise. It was as though some one were alternately
opening and shutting a casement, or, more
likely, amusing himself by making sunlight flashes
with a pocket-mirror.</p>
<p>"It's a child having a game!" I cried, after a
moment or two, feeling a little irritated by the trivial
occupation that had been thrust upon me.</p>
<p>"Never mind, go on!"</p>
<p>And I counted away.... And I put down
rows of figures.... And the sun continued to
play in front of me, with mathematical precision.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Lupin, after a longer pause than
usual.</p>
<p>"Why, it seems finished.... There has been
nothing for some minutes...."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6" name="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>We waited and, as no more light flashed through
space, I said, jestingly:</p>
<p>"My idea is that we have been wasting our time.
A few figures on paper: a poor result!"</p>
<p>Lupin, without stirring from his sofa, rejoined:</p>
<p>"Oblige me, old chap, by putting in the place
of each of those numbers the corresponding letter
of the alphabet. Count A as 1, B as 2 and so on.
Do you follow me?"</p>
<p>"But it's idiotic!"</p>
<p>"Absolutely idiotic, but we do such a lot of
idiotic things in this life.... One more or less,
you know!..."</p>
<p>I sat down to this silly work and wrote out the
first letters:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"<i>Take no....</i>"</p></div>
<p>I broke off in surprise:</p>
<p>"Words!" I exclaimed. "Two English words
meaning...."</p>
<p>"Go on, old chap."</p>
<p>And I went on and the next letters formed two
more words, which I separated as they appeared.
And, to my great amazement, a complete English
sentence lay before my eyes.</p>
<p>"Done?" asked Lupin, after a time.</p>
<p>"Done!... By the way, there are mistakes
in the spelling...."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7" name="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>"Never mind those and read it out, please....
Read slowly."</p>
<p>Thereupon I read out the following unfinished
communication, which I will set down as it appeared
on the paper in front of me:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"<i>Take no unnecessery risks. Above all, avoid atacks,
approach ennemy with great prudance and....</i>"</p></div>
<p>I began to laugh:</p>
<p>"And there you are! <i>Fiat lux!</i> We're simply
dazed with light! But, after all, Lupin, confess
that this advice, dribbled out by a kitchen-maid,
doesn't help you much!"</p>
<p>Lupin rose, without breaking his contemptuous
silence, and took the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>I remembered soon after that, at this moment,
I happened to look at the clock. It was eighteen
minutes past five.</p>
<p>Lupin was standing with the paper in his hand;
and I was able at my ease to watch, on his
youthful features, that extraordinary mobility of
expression which baffles all observers and constitutes
his great strength and his chief safeguard.
By what signs can one hope to identify a face which
changes at pleasure, even without the help of
make-up, and whose every transient expression
seems to be the final, definite expression?...
By what signs? There was one which I knew well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8" name="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
an invariable sign: Two little crossed wrinkles
that marked his forehead whenever he made a powerful
effort of concentration. And I saw it at that
moment, saw the tiny tell-tale cross, plainly
and deeply scored.</p>
<p>He put down the sheet of paper and muttered:</p>
<p>"Child's play!"</p>
<p>The clock struck half-past five.</p>
<p>"What!" I cried. "Have you succeeded?...
In twelve minutes?..."</p>
<p>He took a few steps up and down the room, lit
a cigarette and said:</p>
<p>"You might ring up Baron Repstein, if you don't
mind, and tell him I shall be with him at ten o'clock
this evening."</p>
<p>"Baron Repstein?" I asked. "The husband of
the famous baroness?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Are you serious?"</p>
<p>"Quite serious."</p>
<p>Feeling absolutely at a loss, but incapable of
resisting him, I opened the telephone-directory
and unhooked the receiver. But, at that moment,
Lupin stopped me with a peremptory gesture and
said, with his eyes on the paper, which he had taken
up again:</p>
<p>"No, don't say anything.... It's no use
letting him know.... There's something more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9" name="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
urgent ... a queer thing that puzzles me.... Why
on earth wasn't the last sentence finished?
Why is the sentence...."</p>
<p>He snatched up his hat and stick:</p>
<p>"Let's be off. If I'm not mistaken, this is a business
that requires immediate solution; and I don't
believe I <i>am</i> mistaken."</p>
<p>He put his arm through mine, as we went down
the stairs, and said:</p>
<p>"I know what everybody knows. Baron Repstein,
the company-promoter and racing-man,
whose colt Etna won the Derby and the Grand
Prix this year, has been victimized by his wife.
The wife, who was well known for her fair hair,
her dress and her extravagance, ran away a fortnight
ago, taking with her a sum of three million francs,
stolen from her husband, and quite a collection of
diamonds, pearls and jewellery which the Princesse
de Berny had placed in her hands and which she
was supposed to buy. For two weeks the police
have been pursuing the baroness across France
and the continent: an easy job, as she scatters
gold and jewels wherever she goes. They think they
have her every moment. Two days ago, our champion
detective, the egregious Ganimard, arrested
a visitor at a big hotel in Belgium, a woman against
whom the most positive evidence seemed to be
heaped up. On enquiry, the lady turned out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10" name="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to be a notorious chorus-girl called Nelly Darbal.
As for the baroness, she has vanished. The baron,
on his side, has offered a reward of two hundred
thousand francs to whosoever finds his wife. The
money is in the hands of a solicitor. Moreover, he
has sold his racing-stud, his house on the Boulevard
Haussmann and his country-seat of Roquencourt
in one lump, so that he may indemnify the Princesse
de Berny for her loss."</p>
<p>"And the proceeds of the sale," I added, "are
to be paid over at once. The papers say that
the princess will have her money to-morrow.
Only, frankly, I fail to see the connection between
this story, which you have told very well, and the
puzzling sentence...."</p>
<p>Lupin did not condescend to reply.</p>
<p>We had been walking down the street in which I
live and had passed some four or five houses, when
he stepped off the pavement and began to examine
a block of flats, not of the latest construction,
which looked as if it contained a large number of
tenants:</p>
<p>"According to my calculations," he said, "this
is where the signals came from, probably from that
open window."</p>
<p>"On the third floor?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>He went to the portress and asked her:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11" name="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>"Does one of your tenants happen to be acquainted
with Baron Repstein?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course!" replied the woman. "We
have M. Lavernoux here, such a nice gentleman;
he is the baron's secretary and agent. I look after
his flat."</p>
<p>"And can we see him?"</p>
<p>"See him?... The poor gentleman is very ill."</p>
<p>"Ill?"</p>
<p>"He's been ill a fortnight ... ever since the
trouble with the baroness.... He came home
the next day with a temperature and took to his
bed."</p>
<p>"But he gets up, surely?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that I can't say!"</p>
<p>"How do you mean, you can't say?"</p>
<p>"No, his doctor won't let any one into his room.
He took my key from me."</p>
<p>"Who did?"</p>
<p>"The doctor. He comes and sees to his wants,
two or three times a day. He left the house only
twenty minutes ago ... an old gentleman with
a grey beard and spectacles.... Walks quite
bent.... But where are you going sir?"</p>
<p>"I'm going up, show me the way," said Lupin,
with his foot on the stairs. "It's the third floor,
isn't it, on the left?"</p>
<p>"But I mustn't!" moaned the portress, run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12" name="Page_12">[12]</a></span>ning
after him. "Besides, I haven't the key ...
the doctor...."</p>
<p>They climbed the three flights, one behind the
other. On the landing, Lupin took a tool from his
pocket and, disregarding the woman's protests,
inserted it in the lock. The door yielded almost
immediately. We went in.</p>
<p>At the back of a small dark room we saw a streak
of light filtering through a door that had been left
ajar. Lupin ran across the room and, on reaching
the threshold, gave a cry:</p>
<p>"Too late! Oh, hang it all!"</p>
<p>The portress fell on her knees, as though fainting.</p>
<p>I entered the bedroom, in my turn, and saw a
man lying half-dressed on the carpet, with his legs
drawn up under him, his arms contorted and his
face quite white, an emaciated, fleshless face, with
the eyes still staring in terror and the mouth twisted
into a hideous grin.</p>
<p>"He's dead," said Lupin, after a rapid examination.</p>
<p>"But why?" I exclaimed. "There's not a trace
of blood!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, there is," replied Lupin, pointing to
two or three drops that showed on the chest,
through the open shirt. "Look, they must have
taken him by the throat with one hand and pricked
him to the heart with the other. I say, 'pricked,'
because really the wound can't be seen. It suggests
a hole made by a very long needle."</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">He looked on the floor, all round the corpse. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13" name="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was nothing to attract his attention, except a little
pocket-mirror, the little mirror with which M.
Lavernoux had amused himself by making the sunbeams
dance through space.</p>
<p>But, suddenly, as the portress was breaking into
lamentations and calling for help, Lupin flung himself
on her and shook her:</p>
<p>"Stop that!... Listen to me ... you
can call out later.... Listen to me and answer
me. It is most important. M. Lavernoux had a
friend living in this street, had he not? On the same
side, to the right? An intimate friend?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"A friend whom he used to meet at the café in
the evening and with whom he exchanged the illustrated
papers?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Was the friend an Englishman?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What's his name?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Hargrove."</p>
<p>"Where does he live?"</p>
<p>"At No. 92 in this street."</p>
<p>"One word more: had that old doctor been attending
him long?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14" name="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>"No. I did not know him. He came on the
evening when M. Lavernoux was taken ill."</p>
<p>Without another word, Lupin dragged me away
once more, ran down the stairs and, once in the
street, turned to the right, which took us past my
flat again. Four doors further, he stopped at
No. 92, a small, low-storied house, of which the
ground-floor was occupied by the proprietor of a
dram-shop, who stood smoking in his doorway,
next to the entrance-passage. Lupin asked if Mr.
Hargrove was at home.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hargrove went out about half-an-hour
ago," said the publican. "He seemed very much
excited and took a taxi-cab, a thing he doesn't
often do."</p>
<p>"And you don't know...."</p>
<p>"Where he was going? Well, there's no secret
about it He shouted it loud enough! 'Prefecture
of Police' is what he said to the driver...."</p>
<p>Lupin was himself just hailing a taxi, when he
changed his mind; and I heard him mutter:</p>
<p>"What's the good? He's got too much start of
us...."</p>
<p>He asked if any one called after Mr. Hargrove had
gone.</p>
<p>"Yes, an old gentleman with a grey beard and
spectacles. He went up to Mr. Hargrove's, rang the
bell, and went away again."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15" name="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am much obliged," said Lupin, touching his
hat.</p>
<p>He walked away slowly without speaking to me,
wearing a thoughtful air. There was no doubt that
the problem struck him as very difficult, and that
he saw none too clearly in the darkness through which
he seemed to be moving with such certainty.</p>
<p>He himself, for that matter, confessed to me:</p>
<p>"These are cases that require much more intuition
than reflection. But this one, I may tell you, is well
worth taking pains about."</p>
<p>We had now reached the boulevards. Lupin
entered a public reading-room and spent a long
time consulting the last fortnight's newspapers.
Now and again, he mumbled:</p>
<p>"Yes ... yes ... of course ... it's
only a guess, but it explains everything....
Well, a guess that answers every question is not far
from being the truth...."</p>
<p>It was now dark. We dined at a little restaurant
and I noticed that Lupin's face became gradually
more animated. His gestures were more decided.
He recovered his spirits, his liveliness. When we
left, during the walk which he made me take along
the Boulevard Haussmann, towards Baron Repstein's
house, he was the real Lupin of the great
occasions, the Lupin who had made up his mind to
go in and win.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16" name="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>We slackened our pace just short of the Rue de
Courcelles. Baron Repstein lived on the left-hand
side, between this street and the Faubourg Saint-Honoré,
in a three-storied private house of which
we could see the front, decorated with columns and
caryatides.</p>
<p>"Stop!" said Lupin, suddenly.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Another proof to confirm my supposition...."</p>
<p>"What proof? I see nothing."</p>
<p>"I do.... That's enough...."</p>
<p>He turned up the collar of his coat, lowered the
brim of his soft hat and said:</p>
<p>"By Jove, it'll be a stiff fight! Go to bed, my
friend. I'll tell you about my expedition to-morrow
... if it doesn't cost me my life."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what I'm saying! I'm risking a
lot. First of all, getting arrested, which isn't much.
Next, getting killed, which is worse. But...."
He gripped my shoulder. "But there's a third
thing I'm risking, which is getting hold of two millions....
And, once I possess a capital of
two millions, I'll show people what I can do! Good-night,
old chap, and, if you never see me again...."
He spouted Musset's lines:</p>
<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Plant a willow by my grave,</span><br/>
<span class="i2">The weeping willow that I love...."</span><br/>
</div></div>
<p>I walked away. Three minutes later—I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17" name="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
continuing the narrative as he told it to me next
day—three minutes later, Lupin rang at the door
of the Hôtel Repstein.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>"Is monsieur le baron at home?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the butler, examining the intruder
with an air of surprise, "but monsieur le baron does
not see people as late as this."</p>
<p>"Does monsieur le baron know of the murder of
M. Lavernoux, his land-agent?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Well, please tell monsieur le baron that I have
come about the murder and that there is not a moment
to lose."</p>
<p>A voice called from above:</p>
<p>"Show the gentleman up, Antoine."</p>
<p>In obedience to this peremptory order, the butler
led the way to the first floor. In an open doorway
stood a gentleman whom Lupin recognized
from his photograph in the papers as Baron Repstein,
husband of the famous baroness and owner of Etna,
the horse of the year.</p>
<p>He was an exceedingly tall, square-shouldered
man. His clean-shaven face wore a pleasant, almost
smiling expression, which was not affected by the
sadness of his eyes. He was dressed in a well-cut
morning-coat, with a tan waistcoat and a dark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18" name="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
tie fastened with a pearl pin, the value of which struck
Lupin as considerable.</p>
<p>He took Lupin into his study, a large, three-windowed
room, lined with book-cases, sets of pigeonholes,
an American desk and a safe. And he at once
asked, with ill-concealed eagerness:</p>
<p>"Do you know anything?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur le baron."</p>
<p>"About the murder of that poor Lavernoux?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur le baron, and about madame le
baronne also."</p>
<p>"Do you really mean it? Quick, I entreat
you...."</p>
<p>He pushed forward a chair. Lupin sat down and
began:</p>
<p>"Monsieur le baron, the circumstances are very
serious. I will be brief."</p>
<p>"Yes, do, please."</p>
<p>"Well, monsieur le baron, in a few words, it
amounts to this: five or six hours ago, Lavernoux,
who, for the last fortnight, had been kept in a sort
of enforced confinement by his doctor, Lavernoux—how
shall I put it?—telegraphed certain revelations
by means of signals which were partly taken
down by me and which put me on the track of this
case. He himself was surprised in the act of making
this communication and was murdered."</p>
<p>"But by whom? By whom?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19" name="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>"By his doctor."</p>
<p>"Who is this doctor?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. But one of M. Lavernoux's
friends, an Englishman called Hargrove, the friend,
in fact, with whom he was communicating, is
bound to know and is also bound to know the
exact and complete meaning of the communication,
because, without waiting for the end, he jumped
into a motor-cab and drove to the Prefecture of
Police."</p>
<p>"Why? Why?... And what is the result
of that step?"</p>
<p>"The result, monsieur le baron, is that your house
is surrounded. There are twelve detectives under
your windows. The moment the sun rises, they
will enter in the name of the law and arrest the
criminal."</p>
<p>"Then is Lavernoux's murderer concealed in my
house? Who is he? One of the servants? But no,
for you were speaking of a doctor!..."</p>
<p>"I would remark, monsieur le baron, that when
this Mr. Hargrove went to the police to tell them
of the revelations made by his friend Lavernoux, he
was not aware that his friend Lavernoux was going to
be murdered. The step taken by Mr Hargrove had
to do with something else...."</p>
<p>"With what?"</p>
<p>"With the disappearance of madame la baronne,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20" name="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of which he knew the secret, thanks to the communication
made by Lavernoux."</p>
<p>"What! They know at last! They have found
the baroness! Where is she? And the jewels? And
the money she robbed me of?"</p>
<p>Baron Repstein was talking in a great state of
excitement. He rose and, almost shouting at
Lupin, cried:</p>
<p>"Finish your story, sir! I can't endure this
suspense!"</p>
<p>Lupin continued, in a slow and hesitating voice:</p>
<p>"The fact is ... you see ... it is rather
difficult to explain ... for you and I are looking
at the thing from a totally different point of view."</p>
<p>"I don't understand."</p>
<p>"And yet you ought to understand, monsieur le
baron.... We begin by saying—I am quoting
the newspapers—by saying, do we not, that Baroness
Repstein knew all the secrets of your business and
that she was able to open not only that safe over
there, but also the one at the Crédit Lyonnais in
which you kept your securities locked up?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, one evening, a fortnight ago, while you
were at your club, Baroness Repstein, who, unknown
to yourself, had converted all those securities into
cash, left this house with a travelling-bag, containing
your money and all the Princesse de Berny's jewels?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21" name="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And, since then, she has not been seen?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, there is an excellent reason why she has
not been seen."</p>
<p>"What reason?"</p>
<p>"This, that Baroness Repstein has been murdered...."</p>
<p>"Murdered!... The baroness!... But
you're mad!"</p>
<p>"Murdered ... and probably that same evening."</p>
<p>"I tell you again, you are mad! How can the
baroness have been murdered, when the police are
following her tracks, so to speak, step by step?"</p>
<p>"They are following the tracks of another
woman."</p>
<p>"What woman?"</p>
<p>"The murderer's accomplice."</p>
<p>"And who is the murderer?"</p>
<p>"The same man who, for the last fortnight, knowing
that Lavernoux, through the situation which
he occupied in this house, had discovered the truth,
kept him imprisoned, forced him to silence, threatened
him, terrorized him; the same man who, finding
Lavernoux in the act of communicating with a friend,
made away with him in cold blood by stabbing him
to the heart."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22" name="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>"The doctor, therefore?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But who is this doctor? Who is this malevolent
genius, this infernal being who appears and
disappears, who slays in the dark and whom nobody
suspects?"</p>
<p>"Can't you guess?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"And do you want to know?"</p>
<p>"Do I want to know?... Why, speak, man,
speak!... You know where he is hiding?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In this house?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And it is he whom the police are after?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And I know him?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"You!"</p>
<p>"I!..."</p>
<p>Lupin had not been more than ten minutes with
the baron; and the duel was commencing. The
accusation was hurled, definitely, violently, implacably.</p>
<p>Lupin repeated:</p>
<p>"You yourself, got up in a false beard and a
pair of spectacles, bent in two, like an old man.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23" name="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
In short, you, Baron Repstein; and it is you for a
very good reason, of which nobody has thought,
which is that, if it was not you who contrived the
whole plot, the case becomes inexplicable. Whereas,
taking you as the criminal, you as murdering the
baroness in order to get rid of her and run through
those millions with another woman, you as murdering
Lavernoux, your agent, in order to suppress
an unimpeachable witness, oh, then the whole case
is explained! Well, is it pretty clear? And are not
you yourself convinced?"</p>
<p>The baron, who, throughout this conversation,
had stood bending over his visitor, waiting for each
of his words with feverish avidity, now drew himself
up and looked at Lupin as though he undoubtedly
had to do with a madman. When Lupin had finished
speaking, the baron stepped back two or three
paces, seemed on the point of uttering words which
he ended by not saying, and then, without taking
his eyes from his strange visitor, went to the fireplace
and rang the bell.</p>
<p>Lupin did not make a movement. He waited
smiling.</p>
<p>The butler entered. His master said:</p>
<p>"You can go to bed, Antoine. I will let this
gentleman out."</p>
<p>"Shall I put out the lights, sir?"</p>
<p>"Leave a light in the hall."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24" name="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>Antoine left the room and the baron, after taking
a revolver from his desk, at once came back to
Lupin, put the weapon in his pocket and said,
very calmly:</p>
<p>"You must excuse this little precaution, sir.
I am obliged to take it in case you should be mad,
though that does not seem likely. No, you are
not mad. But you have come here with an object
which I fail to grasp; and you have sprung upon
me an accusation of so astounding a character
that I am curious to know the reason. I have
experienced so much disappointment and undergone
so much suffering that an outrage of this kind leaves
me indifferent. Continue, please."</p>
<p>His voice shook with emotion and his sad eyes
seemed moist with tears.</p>
<p>Lupin shuddered. Had he made a mistake?
Was the surmise which his intuition had suggested
to him and which was based upon a frail groundwork
of slight facts, was this surmise wrong?</p>
<p>His attention was caught by a detail: through
the opening in the baron's waistcoat he saw the
point of the pin fixed in the tie and was thus
able to realize the unusual length of the pin. Moreover,
the gold stem was triangular and formed a sort
of miniature dagger, very thin and very delicate, yet
formidable in an expert hand.</p>
<p>And Lupin had no doubt but that the pin attached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25" name="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to that magnificent pearl was the weapon which had
pierced the heart of the unfortunate M. Lavernoux.</p>
<p>He muttered:</p>
<p>"You're jolly clever, monsieur le baron!"</p>
<p>The other, maintaining a rather scornful gravity,
kept silence, as though he did not understand and
as though waiting for the explanation to which he
felt himself entitled. And, in spite of everything,
this impassive attitude worried Arsène Lupin.
Nevertheless, his conviction was so profound and,
besides, he had staked so much on the adventure that
he repeated:</p>
<p>"Yes, jolly clever, for it is evident that the
baroness only obeyed your orders in realizing
your securities and also in borrowing the princess's
jewels on the pretence of buying them. And it
is evident that the person who walked out of your
house with a bag was not your wife, but an accomplice,
that chorus-girl probably, and that it is your
chorus-girl who is deliberately allowing herself
to be chased across the continent by our worthy
Ganimard. And I look upon the trick as marvellous.
What does the woman risk, seeing that
it is the baroness who is being looked for? And
how could they look for any other woman than
the baroness, seeing that you have promised a
reward of two hundred thousand francs to the
person who finds the baroness?... Oh, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26" name="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
two hundred thousand francs lodged with a solicitor:
what a stroke of genius! It has dazzled the
police! It has thrown dust in the eyes of the most
clear-sighted! A gentleman who lodges two hundred
thousand francs with a solicitor is a gentleman
who speaks the truth.... So they go on
hunting the baroness! And they leave you quietly
to settle your affairs, to sell your stud and your
two houses to the highest bidder and to prepare your
flight! Heavens, what a joke!"</p>
<p>The baron did not wince. He walked up to
Lupin and asked, without abandoning his imperturbable
coolness:</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>Lupin burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"What can it matter who I am? Take it that
I am an emissary of fate, looming out of the darkness
for your destruction!"</p>
<p>He sprang from his chair, seized the baron by the
shoulder and jerked out:</p>
<p>"Yes, for your destruction, my bold baron! Listen
to me! Your wife's three millions, almost
all the princess's jewels, the money you received
to-day from the sale of your stud and your real
estate: it's all there, in your pocket, or in that
safe. Your flight is prepared. Look, I can see
the leather of your portmanteau behind that
hanging. The papers on your desk are in order.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27" name="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
This very night, you would have done a guy. This
very night, disguised beyond recognition, after
taking all your precautions, you would have
joined your chorus-girl, the creature for whose
sake you have committed murder, that same Nelly
Darbal, no doubt, whom Ganimard arrested in
Belgium. But for one sudden, unforeseen obstacle:
the police, the twelve detectives who, thanks
to Lavernoux's revelations, have been posted
under your windows. They've cooked your
goose, old chap!... Well, I'll save you.
A word through the telephone; and, by three or
four o'clock in the morning, twenty of my friends
will have removed the obstacle, polished off the
twelve detectives, and you and I will slip away
quietly. My conditions? Almost nothing; a trifle
to you: we share the millions and the jewels. Is it
a bargain?"</p>
<p>He was leaning over the baron, thundering at him
with irresistible energy. The baron whispered:</p>
<p>"I'm beginning to understand. It's blackmail...."</p>
<p>"Blackmail or not, call it what you please, my
boy, but you've got to go through with it and do
as I say. And don't imagine that I shall give
way at the last moment. Don't say to yourself,
'Here's a gentleman whom the fear of the police
will cause to think twice. If I run a big risk in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28" name="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
refusing, he also will be risking the handcuffs,
the cells and the rest of it, seeing that we are both
being hunted down like wild beasts.' That would
be a mistake, monsieur le baron. I can always
get out of it. It's a question of yourself, of yourself
alone.... Your money or your life, my lord!
Share and share alike ... if not, the scaffold!
Is it a bargain?"</p>
<p>A quick movement. The baron released himself,
grasped his revolver and fired.</p>
<p>But Lupin was prepared for the attack, the more
so as the baron's face had lost its assurance and
gradually, under the slow impulse of rage and
fear, acquired an expression of almost bestial ferocity
that heralded the rebellion so long kept under
control.</p>
<p>He fired twice. Lupin first flung himself to one
side and then dived at the baron's knees, seized
him by both legs and brought him to the ground.
The baron freed himself with an effort. The two
enemies rolled over in each other's grip; and a stubborn,
crafty, brutal, savage struggle followed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lupin felt a pain at his chest:</p>
<p>"You villain!" he yelled. "That's your Lavernoux
trick; the tie-pin!"</p>
<p>Stiffening his muscles with a desperate effort,
he overpowered the baron and clutched him by the
throat victorious at last and omnipotent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29" name="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>"You ass!" he cried. "If you hadn't shown
your cards, I might have thrown up the game!
You have such a look of the honest man about
you! But what a biceps, my lord!... I thought
for a moment.... But it's all over, now!...
Come, my friend, hand us the pin and look cheerful....
No, that's what I call pulling a face....
I'm holding you too tight, perhaps? My
lord's at his last gasp?... Come, be good!...
That's it, just a wee bit of string round the
wrists; do you allow me?... Why, you and I
are agreeing like two brothers! It's touching!...
At heart, you know, I'm rather fond of you....
And now, my bonnie lad, mind yourself! And a
thousand apologies!..."</p>
<p>Half raising himself, with all his strength he
caught the other a terrible blow in the pit of the
stomach. The baron gave a gurgle and lay stunned
and unconscious.</p>
<p>"That comes of having a deficient sense of logic,
my friend," said Lupin. "I offered you half your
money. Now I'll give you none at all ...
provided I know where to find any of it. For that's
the main thing. Where has the beggar hidden his
dust? In the safe? By George, it'll be a tough job!
Luckily, I have all the night before me...."</p>
<p>He began to feel in the baron's pockets, came
upon a bunch of keys, first made sure that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30" name="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
portmanteau behind the curtain held no papers or
jewels, and then went to the safe.</p>
<p>But, at that moment, he stopped short: he heard
a noise somewhere. The servants? Impossible.
Their attics were on the top floor. He listened.
The noise came from below. And, suddenly, he
understood: the detectives, who had heard the
two shots, were banging at the front door, as was
their duty, without waiting for daybreak. Then
an electric bell rang, which Lupin recognized as that
in the hall:</p>
<p>"By Jupiter!" he said. "Pretty work! Here
are these jokers coming ... and just as we were
about to gather the fruits of our laborious efforts!
Tut, tut, Lupin, keep cool! What's expected of
you? To open a safe, of which you don't know
the secret, in thirty seconds. That's a mere trifle
to lose your head about! Come, all you have to do
is to discover the secret! How many letters are there
in the word? Four?"</p>
<p>He went on thinking, while talking and listening
to the noise outside. He double-locked the door
of the outer room and then came back to the safe:</p>
<p>"Four ciphers.... Four letters ... four
letters.... Who can lend me a hand?...
Who can give me just a tiny hint?... Who?
Why, Lavernoux, of course! That good Lavernoux,
seeing that he took the trouble to indulge in optical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31" name="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
telegraphy at the risk of his life.... Lord, what
a fool I am!... Why, of course, why, of course,
that's it!... By Jove, this is too exciting!...
Lupin, you must count ten and suppress that
distracted beating of your heart. If not, it means
bad work."</p>
<p>He counted ten and, now quite calm, knelt in front
of the safe. He turned the four knobs with careful
attention. Next, he examined the bunch of keys,
selected one of them, then another, and attempted,
in vain, to insert them in the lock:</p>
<p>"There's luck in odd numbers," he muttered,
trying a third key. "Victory! This is the right one!
Open Sesame, good old Sesame, open!"</p>
<p>The lock turned. The door moved on its hinges.
Lupin pulled it to him, after taking out the bunch of
keys:</p>
<p>"The millions are ours," he said. "Baron, I
forgive you!"</p>
<p>And then he gave a single bound backward,
hiccoughing with fright. His legs staggered beneath
him. The keys jingled together in his
fevered hand with a sinister sound. And, for
twenty, for thirty seconds, despite the din that was
being raised and the electric bells that kept ringing
through the house, he stood there, wild-eyed, gazing
at the most horrible, the most abominable sight:
a woman's body, half-dressed, bent in two in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32" name="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
safe, crammed in, like an over-large parcel ...
and fair hair hanging down ... and blood ...
clots of blood ... and livid flesh, blue in places,
decomposing, flaccid.</p>
<p>"The baroness!" he gasped. "The baroness!...
Oh, the monster!..."</p>
<p>He roused himself from his torpor, suddenly, to spit
in the murderer's face and pound him with his
heels:</p>
<p>"Take that, you wretch!... Take that, you
villain!... And, with it, the scaffold, the bran-basket!..."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shouts came from the upper floors in
reply to the detectives' ringing. Lupin heard footsteps
scurrying down the stairs. It was time to think
of beating a retreat.</p>
<p>In reality, this did not trouble him greatly. During
his conversation with the baron, the enemy's
extraordinary coolness had given him the feeling that
there must be a private outlet. Besides, how could
the baron have begun the fight, if he were not sure
of escaping the police?</p>
<p>Lupin went into the next room. It looked out
on the garden. At the moment when the detectives
were entering the house, he flung his legs over
the balcony and let himself down by a rain-pipe.
He walked round the building. On the opposite
side was a wall lined with shrubs. He slipped in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33" name="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
between the shrubs and the wall and at once found
a little door which he easily opened with one of
the keys on the bunch. All that remained for him
to do was to walk across a yard and pass through
the empty rooms of a lodge; and in a few moments
he found himself in the Rue du Faubourg
Saint-Honoré. Of course—and this he had reckoned
on—the police had not provided for this secret
outlet.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>"Well, what do you think of Baron Repstein?"
cried Lupin, after giving me all the details of
that tragic night. "What a dirty scoundrel! And
how it teaches one to distrust appearances! I
swear to you, the fellow looked a thoroughly honest
man!"</p>
<p>"But what about the millions?" I asked.
"The princess's jewels?"</p>
<p>"They were in the safe. I remember seeing the
parcel."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"They are there still."</p>
<p>"Impossible!"</p>
<p>"They are, upon my word! I might tell you
that I was afraid of the detectives, or else plead a
sudden attack of delicacy. But the truth is
simpler ... and more prosaic: the smell was
too awful!..."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34" name="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear fellow, the smell that came from
that safe ... from that coffin.... No, I
couldn't do it ... my head swam....
Another second and I should have been ill....
Isn't it silly?... Look, this is all I got from my
expedition: the tie-pin.... The bed-rock value
of the pearl is thirty thousand francs.... But
all the same, I feel jolly well annoyed. What a sell!"</p>
<p>"One more question," I said. "The word that
opened the safe!"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"How did you guess it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, quite easily! In fact, I am surprised that I
didn't think of it sooner."</p>
<p>"Well, tell me."</p>
<p>"It was contained in the revelations telegraphed by
that poor Lavernoux."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Just think, my dear chap, the mistakes in
spelling...."</p>
<p>"The mistakes in spelling?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course! They were deliberate. Surely,
you don't imagine that the agent, the private
secretary of the baron—who was a company-promoter,
mind you, and a racing-man—did not
know English better than to spell 'necessery'
with an 'e,' 'atack' with one 't,' 'ennemy'<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35" name="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with two 'n's' and 'prudance' with an 'a'!
The thing struck me at once. I put the four letters
together and got 'Etna,' the name of the famous
horse."</p>
<p>"And was that one word enough?"</p>
<p>"Of course! It was enough to start with, to
put me on the scent of the Repstein case, of which
all the papers were full, and, next, to make me guess
that it was the key-word of the safe, because, on
the one hand, Lavernoux knew the gruesome contents
of the safe and, on the other, he was denouncing
the baron. And it was in the same way that I was
led to suppose that Lavernoux had a friend in the
street, that they both frequented the same café,
that they amused themselves by working out the
problems and cryptograms in the illustrated papers
and that they had contrived a way of exchanging
telegrams from window to window."</p>
<p>"That makes it all quite simple!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Very simple. And the incident once more
shows that, in the discovery of crimes, there is
something much more valuable than the examination
of facts, than observations, deductions, inferences
and all that stuff and nonsense. What I
mean is, as I said before, intuition ... intuition
and intelligence.... And Arsène Lupin, without
boasting, is deficient in neither one nor the
other!..."</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="chapter"><a id="II" name="II"></a>II</h2>
<h3 class="chapter2">THE WEDDING-RING</h3>
<p>Yvonne d'Origny kissed her son and told him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36" name="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be good:</p>
<p>"You know your grandmother d'Origny is not
very fond of children. Now that she has sent for
you to come and see her, you must show her what
a sensible little boy you are." And, turning to the
governess, "Don't forget, Fräulein, to bring him
home immediately after dinner.... Is monsieur
still in the house?"</p>
<p>"Yes, madame, monsieur le comte is in his
study."</p>
<p>As soon as she was alone, Yvonne d'Origny walked
to the window to catch a glimpse of her son as
he left the house. He was out in the street in
a moment, raised his head and blew her a kiss,
as was his custom every day. Then the governess
took his hand with, as Yvonne remarked to her
surprise, a movement of unusual violence. Yvonne
leant further out of the window and, when the
boy reached the corner of the boulevard, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37" name="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
suddenly saw a man step out of a motor-car and go
up to him. The man, in whom she recognized
Bernard, her husband's confidential servant, took
the child by the arm, made both him and the
governess get into the car, and ordered the chauffeur
to drive off.</p>
<p>The whole incident did not take ten seconds.</p>
<p>Yvonne, in her trepidation, ran to her bedroom,
seized a wrap and went to the door. The door was
locked; and there was no key in the lock.</p>
<p>She hurried back to the boudoir. The door of the
boudoir also was locked.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the image of her husband appeared
before her, that gloomy face which no smile
ever lit up, those pitiless eyes in which, for years,
she had felt so much hatred and malice.</p>
<p>"It's he ... it's he!" she said to herself. "He
has taken the child.... Oh, it's horrible!"</p>
<p>She beat against the door with her fists, with her
feet, then flew to the mantelpiece and pressed the
bell fiercely.</p>
<p>The shrill sound rang through the house from
top to bottom. The servants would be sure to
come. Perhaps a crowd would gather in the street.
And, impelled by a sort of despairing hope, she kept
her finger on the button.</p>
<p>A key turned in the lock.... The door was
flung wide open. The count appeared on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38" name="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
threshold of the boudoir. And the expression of his
face was so terrible that Yvonne began to tremble.</p>
<p>He entered the room. Five or six steps separated
him from her. With a supreme effort, she
tried to stir, but all movement was impossible; and,
when she attempted to speak, she could only flutter
her lips and emit incoherent sounds. She felt
herself lost. The thought of death unhinged her.
Her knees gave way beneath her and she sank into
a huddled heap, with a moan.</p>
<p>The count rushed at her and seized her by the
throat:</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue ... don't call out!" he
said, in a low voice. "That will be best for
you!..."</p>
<p>Seeing that she was not attempting to defend
herself, he loosened his hold of her and took from
his pocket some strips of canvas ready rolled and
of different lengths. In a few minutes, Yvonne was
lying on a sofa, with her wrists and ankles bound
and her arms fastened close to her body.</p>
<p>It was now dark in the boudoir. The count
switched on the electric light and went to a little
writing-desk where Yvonne was accustomed to
keep her letters. Not succeeding in opening it, he
picked the lock with a bent wire, emptied the drawers
and collected all the contents into a bundle, which
he carried off in a cardboard file:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39" name="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>"Waste of time, eh?" he grinned. "Nothing
but bills and letters of no importance.... No
proof against you.... Tah! I'll keep my
son for all that; and I swear before Heaven that I
will not let him go!"</p>
<p>As he was leaving the room, he was joined, near
the door, by his man Bernard. The two stopped
and talked, in a low voice; but Yvonne heard these
words spoken by the servant:</p>
<p>"I have had an answer from the working jeweller.
He says he holds himself at my disposal."</p>
<p>And the count replied:</p>
<p>"The thing is put off until twelve o'clock midday,
to-morrow. My mother has just telephoned to say
that she could not come before."</p>
<p>Then Yvonne heard the key turn in the lock and
the sound of steps going down to the ground-floor,
where her husband's study was.</p>
<p>She long lay inert, her brain reeling with vague,
swift ideas that burnt her in passing, like flames.
She remembered her husband's infamous behaviour,
his humiliating conduct to her, his threats, his
plans for a divorce; and she gradually came to
understand that she was the victim of a regular
conspiracy, that the servants had been sent away
until the following evening by their master's orders,
that the governess had carried off her son by the
count's instructions and with Bernard's assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40" name="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that her son would not come back and that she would
never see him again.</p>
<p>"My son!" she cried. "My son!..."</p>
<p>Exasperated by her grief, she stiffened herself,
with every nerve, with every muscle tense, to make
a violent effort. And she was astonished to find
that her right hand, which the count had fastened too
hurriedly, still retained a certain freedom.</p>
<p>Then a mad hope invaded her; and, slowly, patiently,
she began the work of self-deliverance.</p>
<p>It was long in the doing. She needed a deal of
time to widen the knot sufficiently and a deal of time
afterward, when the hand was released, to undo
those other bonds which tied her arms to her body and
those which fastened her ankles.</p>
<p>Still, the thought of her son sustained her; and
the last shackle fell as the clock struck eight. She
was free!</p>
<p>She was no sooner on her feet than she flew to
the window and flung back the latch, with the
intention of calling the first passer-by. At that
moment a policeman came walking along the
pavement. She leant out. But the brisk evening
air, striking her face, calmed her. She thought
of the scandal, of the judicial investigation, of the
cross-examination, of her son. O Heaven! What
could she do to get him back? How could she
escape? The count might appear at the least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41" name="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sound. And who knew but that, in a moment of
fury ...?</p>
<p>She shivered from head to foot, seized with a sudden
terror. The horror of death mingled, in her poor
brain, with the thought of her son; and she stammered,
with a choking throat:</p>
<p>"Help!... Help!..."</p>
<p>She stopped and said to herself, several times
over, in a low voice, "Help!... Help!..."
as though the word awakened an idea, a memory
within her, and as though the hope of assistance
no longer seemed to her impossible. For some
minutes she remained absorbed in deep meditation,
broken by fears and starts. Then, with an
almost mechanical series of movements, she put
out her arm to a little set of shelves hanging over
the writing-desk, took down four books, one after
the other, turned the pages with a distraught air,
replaced them and ended by finding, between the
pages of the fifth, a visiting-card on which her eyes
spelt the name:</p>
<div class="microspace"> </div>
<div class="center">
HORACE VELMONT,
</div>
<p>followed by an address written in pencil:</p>
<div class="center stext">
<span class="smcap">CERCLE DE LA RUE ROYALE.</span>
</div>
<div class="microspace"> </div>
<p>And her memory conjured up the strange thing
which that man had said to her, a few years before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42" name="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in that same house, on a day when she was at home
to her friends:</p>
<p>"If ever a danger threatens you, if you need help,
do not hesitate; post this card, which you see me
put into this book; and, whatever the hour, whatever
the obstacles, I will come."</p>
<p>With what a curious air he had spoken these
words and how well he had conveyed the impression
of certainty, of strength, of unlimited power, of
indomitable daring!</p>
<p>Abruptly, unconsciously, acting under the impulse
of an irresistible determination, the consequences
of which she refused to anticipate, Yvonne,
with the same automatic gestures, took a pneumatic-delivery
envelope, slipped in the card, sealed it,
directed it to "Horace Velmont, Cercle de la Rue
Royale" and went to the open window. The policeman
was walking up and down outside. She flung
out the envelope, trusting to fate. Perhaps it would
be picked up, treated as a lost letter and posted.</p>
<p>She had hardly completed this act when she realized
its absurdity. It was mad to suppose that the
message would reach the address and madder still
to hope that the man to whom she was sending
could come to her assistance, "whatever the hour,
whatever the obstacles."</p>
<p>A reaction followed which was all the greater
inasmuch as the effort had been swift and violent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43" name="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Yvonne staggered, leant against a chair and, losing
all energy, let herself fall.</p>
<p>The hours passed by, the dreary hours of winter
evenings when nothing but the sound of carriages
interrupts the silence of the street. The clock struck,
pitilessly. In the half-sleep that numbed her limbs,
Yvonne counted the strokes. She also heard certain
noises, on different floors of the house, which
told her that her husband had dined, that he was
going up to his room, that he was going down again
to his study. But all this seemed very shadowy to
her; and her torpor was such that she did not even
think of lying down on the sofa, in case he should
come in....</p>
<p>The twelve strokes of midnight.... Then
half-past twelve ... then one.... Yvonne
thought of nothing, awaiting the events which were
preparing and against which rebellion was useless. She
pictured her son and herself as one pictures those
beings who have suffered much and who suffer no
more and who take each other in their loving arms.
But a nightmare shattered this dream. For now
those two beings were to be torn asunder; and she
had the awful feeling, in her delirium, that she was
crying and choking....</p>
<p>She leapt from her seat. The key had turned in
the lock. The count was coming, attracted by her
cries. Yvonne glanced round for a weapon with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44" name="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which to defend herself. But the door was pushed
back quickly and, astounded, as though the sight
that presented itself before her eyes seemed to her
the most inexplicable prodigy, she stammered:</p>
<p>"You!... You!..."</p>
<p>A man was walking up to her, in dress-clothes,
with his opera-hat and cape under his arm, and this
man, young, slender and elegant, she had recognized
as Horace Velmont.</p>
<p>"You!" she repeated.</p>
<p>He said, with a bow:</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, madame, but I did not receive
your letter until very late."</p>
<p>"Is it possible? Is it possible that this is you ...
that you were able to ...?"</p>
<p>He seemed greatly surprised:</p>
<p>"Did I not promise to come in answer to your
call?"</p>
<p>"Yes ... but ..."</p>
<p>"Well, here I am," he said, with a smile.</p>
<p>He examined the strips of canvas from which
Yvonne had succeeded in freeing herself and nodded
his head, while continuing his inspection:</p>
<p>"So those are the means employed? The Comte
d'Origny, I presume?... I also saw that
he locked you in.... But then the pneumatic
letter?... Ah, through the window!...
How careless of you not to close it!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45" name="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>He pushed both sides to. Yvonne took fright:</p>
<p>"Suppose they hear!"</p>
<p>"There is no one in the house. I have been over
it."</p>
<p>"Still ..."</p>
<p>"Your husband went out ten minutes ago."</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<p>"With his mother, the Comtesse d'Origny."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's very simple! He was rung up by telephone
and I awaited the result at the corner
of this street and the boulevard. As I expected,
the count came out hurriedly, followed by his
man. I at once entered, with the aid of special
keys."</p>
<p>He told this in the most natural way, just as
one tells a meaningless anecdote in a drawing-room.
But Yvonne, suddenly seized with fresh
alarm, asked:</p>
<p>"Then it's not true?... His mother is not
ill?... In that case, my husband will be coming
back...."</p>
<p>"Certainly, the count will see that a trick has
been played on him and in three quarters of an hour
at the latest...."</p>
<p>"Let us go.... I don't want him to find me
here.... I must go to my son...."</p>
<p>"One moment...."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46" name="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>"One moment!... But don't you know that
they have taken him from me?... That they
are hurting him, perhaps?..."</p>
<p>With set face and feverish gestures, she tried to
push Velmont back. He, with great gentleness,
compelled her to sit down and, leaning over her in
a respectful attitude, said, in a serious voice:</p>
<p>"Listen, madame, and let us not waste time,
when every minute is valuable. First of all,
remember this: we met four times, six years ago....
And, on the fourth occasion, when I was
speaking to you, in the drawing-room of this house,
with too much—what shall I say?—with too much
feeling, you gave me to understand that my visits
were no longer welcome. Since that day I have
not seen you. And, nevertheless, in spite of all,
your faith in me was such that you kept the card
which I put between the pages of that book and,
six years later, you send for me and none other.
That faith in me I ask you to continue. You must
obey me blindly. Just as I surmounted every
obstacle to come to you, so I will save you, whatever
the position may be."</p>
<p>Horace Velmont's calmness, his masterful voice,
with the friendly intonation, gradually quieted the
countess. Though still very weak, she gained a
fresh sense of ease and security in that man's
presence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47" name="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>"Have no fear," he went on. "The Comtesse
d'Origny lives at the other end of the Bois
de Vincennes. Allowing that your husband finds
a motor-cab, it is impossible for him to be back
before a quarter-past three. Well, it is twenty-five
to three now. I swear to take you away at three
o'clock exactly and to take you to your son. But
I will not go before I know everything."</p>
<p>"What am I to do?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Answer me and very plainly. We have twenty
minutes. It is enough. But it is not too much."</p>
<p>"Ask me what you want to know."</p>
<p>"Do you think that the count had any ...
any murderous intentions?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then it concerns your son?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"He is taking him away, I suppose, because
he wants to divorce you and marry another woman,
a former friend of yours, whom you have turned
out of your house. Is that it? Oh, I entreat
you, answer me frankly! These are facts of public
notoriety; and your hesitation, your scruples,
must all cease, now that the matter concerns your
son. So your husband wished to marry another
woman?</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The woman has no money. Your husband,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48" name="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
on his side, has gambled away all his property and
has no means beyond the allowance which he receives
from his mother, the Comtesse d'Origny,
and the income of a large fortune which your son
inherited from two of your uncles. It is this
fortune which your husband covets and which he
would appropriate more easily if the child were
placed in his hands. There is only one way:
divorce. Am I right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And what has prevented him until now is your
refusal?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mine and that of my mother-in-law, whose
religious feelings are opposed to divorce. The Comtesse
d'Origny would only yield in case ..."</p>
<p>"In case ...?"</p>
<p>"In case they could prove me guilty of shameful
conduct."</p>
<p>Velmont shrugged his shoulders:</p>
<p>"Therefore he is powerless to do anything against
you or against your son. Both from the legal point
of view and from that of his own interests, he stumbles
against an obstacle which is the most insurmountable
of all: the virtue of an honest woman.
And yet, in spite of everything, he suddenly shows
fight."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that, if a man like the count, after so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49" name="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
many hesitations and in the face of so many difficulties,
risks so doubtful an adventure, it must be because
he thinks he has command of weapons ..."</p>
<p>"What weapons?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. But they exist ... or else he
would not have begun by taking away your son."</p>
<p>Yvonne gave way to her despair:</p>
<p>"Oh, this is horrible!... How do I know
what he may have done, what he may have invented?"</p>
<p>"Try and think.... Recall your memories....
Tell me, in this desk which he has broken
open, was there any sort of letter which he could possibly
turn against you?"</p>
<p>"No ... only bills and addresses...."</p>
<p>"And, in the words he used to you, in his threats,
is there nothing that allows you to guess?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Still ... still," Velmont insisted, "there must
be something." And he continued, "Has the count
a particularly intimate friend ... in whom he
confides?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Did anybody come to see him yesterday?"</p>
<p>"No, nobody."</p>
<p>"Was he alone when he bound you and locked you
in?"</p>
<p>"At that moment, yes."</p>
<p>"But afterward?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50" name="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>"His man, Bernard, joined him near the door
and I heard them talking about a working jeweller...."</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>"And about something that was to happen the
next day, that is, to-day, at twelve o'clock, because
the Comtesse d'Origny could not come earlier."</p>
<p>Velmont reflected:</p>
<p>"Has that conversation any meaning that throws
a light upon your husband's plans?"</p>
<p>"I don't see any."</p>
<p>"Where are your jewels?"</p>
<p>"My husband has sold them all."</p>
<p>"You have nothing at all left?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Not even a ring?"</p>
<p>"No," she said, showing her hands, "none except
this."</p>
<p>"Which is your wedding-ring?"</p>
<p>"Which is my ... wedding—..."</p>
<p>She stopped, nonplussed. Velmont saw her flush
as she stammered:</p>
<p>"Could it be possible?... But no ...
no ... he doesn't know...."</p>
<p>Velmont at once pressed her with questions and
Yvonne stood silent, motionless, anxious-faced. At
last, she replied, in a low voice:</p>
<p>"This is not my wedding-ring. One day, long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51" name="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
ago, it dropped from the mantelpiece in my bedroom,
where I had put it a minute before and, hunt for
it as I might, I could not find it again. So I ordered
another, without saying anything about it ...
and this is the one, on my hand...."</p>
<p>"Did the real ring bear the date of your wedding?"</p>
<p>"Yes ... the 23rd of October."</p>
<p>"And the second?"</p>
<p>"This one has no date."</p>
<p>He perceived a slight hesitation in her and a
confusion which, in point of fact, she did not try to
conceal.</p>
<p>"I implore you," he exclaimed, "don't hide anything
from me.... You see how far we have
gone in a few minutes, with a little logic and calmness....
Let us go on, I ask you as a favour."</p>
<p>"Are you sure," she said, "that it is necessary?"</p>
<p>"I am sure that the least detail is of importance
and that we are nearly attaining our object. But
we must hurry. This is a crucial moment."</p>
<p>"I have nothing to conceal," she said, proudly
raising her head. "It was the most wretched and
the most dangerous period of my life. While
suffering humiliation at home, outside I was surrounded
with attentions, with temptations, with
pitfalls, like any woman who is seen to be neglected
by her husband. Then I remembered: before my
marriage, a man had been in love with me. I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52" name="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
guessed his unspoken love; and he has died since. I
had the name of that man engraved inside the ring;
and I wore it as a talisman. There was no love in me,
because I was the wife of another. But, in my secret
heart, there was a memory, a sad dream, something
sweet and gentle that protected me...."</p>
<p>She had spoken slowly, without embarrassment,
and Velmont did not doubt for a second that she
was telling the absolute truth. He kept silent; and
she, becoming anxious again, asked:</p>
<p>"Do you suppose ... that my husband ...?"</p>
<p>He took her hand and, while examining the plain
gold ring, said:</p>
<p>"The puzzle lies here. Your husband, I don't
know how, knows of the substitution of one ring for
the other. His mother will be here at twelve o'clock.
In the presence of witnesses, he will compel you
to take off your ring; and, in this way, he will obtain
the approval of his mother and, at the same time,
will be able to obtain his divorce, because he will
have the proof for which he was seeking."</p>
<p>"I am lost!" she moaned. "I am lost!"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, you are saved! Give me
that ring ... and presently he will find another
there, another which I will send you, to reach you
before twelve, and which will bear the date of the
23rd of October. So...."</p>
<p>He suddenly broke off. While he was speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53" name="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Yvonne's hand had turned ice-cold in his; and,
raising his eyes, he saw that the young woman was
pale, terribly pale:</p>
<p>"What's the matter? I beseech you ..."</p>
<p>She yielded to a fit of mad despair:</p>
<p>"This is the matter, that I am lost!... This
is the matter, that I can't get the ring off! It has
grown too small for me!... Do you understand?...
It made no difference and I did not give it a
thought.... But to-day ... this proof ...
this accusation.... Oh, what torture!... Look ...
it forms part of my finger ... it has grown
into my flesh ... and I can't ... I can't...."</p>
<p>She pulled at the ring, vainly, with all her might, at
the risk of injuring herself. But the flesh swelled up
around the ring; and the ring did not budge.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she cried, seized with an idea that terrified
her. "I remember ... the other night ...
a nightmare I had.... It seemed to me that
some one entered my room and caught hold of my
hand.... And I could not wake up....
It was he! It was he! He had put me to sleep, I was
sure of it ... and he was looking at the ring....
And presently he will pull it off before his
mother's eyes.... Ah, I understand everything:
that working jeweller!... He will cut
it from my hand to-morrow.... You see, you
see.... I am lost!..."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54" name="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>She hid her face in her hands and began to weep.
But, amid the silence, the clock struck once ...
and twice ... and yet once more. And
Yvonne drew herself up with a jerk:</p>
<p>"There he is!" she cried. "He is coming!...
It is three o'clock!... Let us go!..."</p>
<p>She grabbed at her cloak and ran to the door ...
Velmont barred the way and, in a masterful tone:</p>
<p>"You shall not go!"</p>
<p>"My son.... I want to see him, to take him
back...."</p>
<p>"You don't even know where he is!"</p>
<p>"I want to go."</p>
<p>"You shall not go!... It would be madness...."</p>
<p>He took her by the wrists. She tried to release
herself; and Velmont had to employ a little force
to overcome her resistance. In the end, he succeeded
in getting her back to the sofa, then in laying
her at full length and, at once, without heeding her
lamentations, he took the canvas strips and fastened
her wrists and ankles:</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "It would be madness! Who
would have set you free? Who would have opened
that door for you? An accomplice? What an
argument against you and what a pretty use your
husband would make of it with his mother!...
And, besides, what's the good? To run away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55" name="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
means accepting divorce ... and what might
that not lead to?... You must stay here...."</p>
<p>She sobbed:</p>
<p>"I'm frightened.... I'm frightened ...
this ring burns me.... Break it.... Take
it away.... Don't let him find it!"</p>
<p>"And if it is not found on your finger, who will
have broken it? Again an accomplice.... No,
you must face the music ... and face it boldly,
for I answer for everything.... Believe me ...
I answer for everything.... If I have
to tackle the Comtesse d'Origny bodily and thus delay
the interview.... If I had to come myself
before noon ... it is the real wedding-ring that
shall be taken from your finger—that I swear!—and
your son shall be restored to you."</p>
<p>Swayed and subdued, Yvonne instinctively held
out her hands to the bonds. When he stood up, she
was bound as she had been before.</p>
<p>He looked round the room to make sure that no
trace of his visit remained. Then he stooped over the
countess again and whispered:</p>
<p>"Think of your son and, whatever happens, fear
nothing.... I am watching over you."</p>
<p>She heard him open and shut the door of the boudoir
and, a few minutes later, the hall-door.</p>
<p>At half-past three, a motor-cab drew up. The
door downstairs was slammed again; and, almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56" name="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
immediately after, Yvonne saw her husband hurry in,
with a furious look in his eyes. He ran up to her,
felt to see if she was still fastened and, snatching her
hand, examined the ring. Yvonne fainted....</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>She could not tell, when she woke, how long she had
slept. But the broad light of day was filling the
boudoir; and she perceived, at the first movement
which she made, that her bonds were cut. Then
she turned her head and saw her husband standing
beside her, looking at her:</p>
<p>"My son ... my son ..." she moaned.
"I want my son...."</p>
<p>He replied, in a voice of which she felt the jeering
insolence:</p>
<p>"Our son is in a safe place. And, for the moment,
it's a question not of him, but of you. We are
face to face with each other, probably for the
last time, and the explanation between us will be
a very serious one. I must warn you that it will
take place before my mother. Have you any
objection?"</p>
<p>Yvonne tried to hide her agitation and answered:</p>
<p>"None at all."</p>
<p>"Can I send for her?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Leave me, in the meantime. I shall be
ready when she comes."</p>
<p>"My mother is here."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57" name="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>"Your mother is here?" cried Yvonne, in dismay,
remembering Horace Velmont's promise.</p>
<p>"What is there to astonish you in that?"</p>
<p>"And is it now ... is it at once that you
want to ...?</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why?... Why not this evening?...
Why not to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"To-day and now," declared the count. "A rather
curious incident happened in the course of last
night, an incident which I cannot account for and
which decided me to hasten the explanation. Don't
you want something to eat first?"</p>
<p>"No ... no...."</p>
<p>"Then I will go and fetch my mother."</p>
<p>He turned to Yvonne's bedroom. Yvonne
glanced at the clock. It marked twenty-five minutes
to eleven!</p>
<p>"Ah!" she said, with a shiver of fright.</p>
<p>Twenty-five minutes to eleven! Horace Velmont
would not save her and nobody in the world
and nothing in the world would save her, for there
was no miracle that could place the wedding-ring
upon her finger.</p>
<p>The count, returning with the Comtesse d'Origny,
asked her to sit down. She was a tall, lank, angular
woman, who had always displayed a hostile feeling
to Yvonne. She did not even bid her daughter-in-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58" name="Page_58">[58]</a></span>law
good-morning, showing that her mind was made
up as regards the accusation:</p>
<p>"I don't think," she said, "that we need speak at
length. In two words, my son maintains...."</p>
<p>"I don't maintain, mother," said the count, "I
declare. I declare on my oath that, three months
ago, during the holidays, the upholsterer, when laying
the carpet in this room and the boudoir, found
the wedding-ring which I gave my wife lying in
a crack in the floor. Here is the ring. The date of
the 23rd of October is engraved inside."</p>
<p>"Then," said the countess, "the ring which your
wife carries...."</p>
<p>"That is another ring, which she ordered in exchange
for the real one. Acting on my instructions,
Bernard, my man, after long searching, ended by
discovering in the outskirts of Paris, where he now
lives, the little jeweller to whom she went. This
man remembers perfectly and is willing to bear
witness that his customer did not tell him to
engrave a date, but a name. He has forgotten
the name, but the man who used to work with him
in his shop may be able to remember it. This
working jeweller has been informed by letter that
I required his services and he replied yesterday,
placing himself at my disposal. Bernard went to
fetch him at nine o'clock this morning. They are
both waiting in my study."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59" name="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>He turned to his wife:</p>
<p>"Will you give me that ring of your own free
will?"</p>
<p>"You know," she said, "from the other night, that
it won't come off my finger."</p>
<p>"In that case, can I have the man up? He has the
necessary implements with him."</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, in a voice faint as a whisper.</p>
<p>She was resigned. She conjured up the future
as in a vision: the scandal, the decree of divorce
pronounced against herself, the custody of the
child awarded to the father; and she accepted this,
thinking that she would carry off her son, that she
would go with him to the ends of the earth and
that the two of them would live alone together and
happy....</p>
<p>Her mother-in-law said:</p>
<p>"You have been very thoughtless, Yvonne."</p>
<p>Yvonne was on the point of confessing to her and
asking for her protection. But what was the good?
How could the Comtesse d'Origny possibly believe
her innocent? She made no reply.</p>
<p>Besides, the count at once returned, followed by
his servant and by a man carrying a bag of tools under
his arm.</p>
<p>And the count said to the man:</p>
<p>"You know what you have to do?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the workman. "It's to cut a ring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60" name="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that's grown too small.... That's easily done....
A touch of the nippers...."</p>
<p>"And then you will see," said the count, "if
the inscription inside the ring was the one you engraved."</p>
<p>Yvonne looked at the clock. It was ten minutes
to eleven. She seemed to hear, somewhere in the
house, a sound of voices raised in argument; and,
in spite of herself, she felt a thrill of hope. Perhaps
Velmont has succeeded.... But the sound was
renewed; and she perceived that it was produced
by some costermongers passing under her window
and moving farther on.</p>
<p>It was all over. Horace Velmont had been unable
to assist her. And she understood that, to recover
her child, she must rely upon her own strength, for
the promises of others are vain.</p>
<p>She made a movement of recoil. She had felt
the workman's heavy hand on her hand; and that
hateful touch revolted her.</p>
<p>The man apologized, awkwardly. The count said
to his wife:</p>
<p>"You must make up your mind, you know."</p>
<p>Then she put out her slim and trembling hand
to the workman, who took it, turned it over and
rested it on the table, with the palm upward.
Yvonne felt the cold steel. She longed to die,
then and there; and, at once attracted by that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61" name="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
idea of death, she thought of the poisons which she
would buy and which would send her to sleep almost
without her knowing it.</p>
<p>The operation did not take long. Inserted on the
slant, the little steel pliers pushed back the flesh,
made room for themselves and bit the ring. A strong
effort ... and the ring broke. The two ends
had only to be separated to remove the ring from
the finger. The workman did so.</p>
<p>The count exclaimed, in triumph:</p>
<p>"At last! Now we shall see!... The proof
is there! And we are all witnesses...."</p>
<p>He snatched up the ring and looked at the inscription.
A cry of amazement escaped him. The
ring bore the date of his marriage to Yvonne: "23rd
of October"!...</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>We were sitting on the terrace at Monte Carlo.
Lupin finished his story, lit a cigarette and calmly
puffed the smoke into the blue air.</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well what?"</p>
<p>"Why, the end of the story...."</p>
<p>"The end of the story? But what other end could
there be?"</p>
<p>"Come ... you're joking ..."</p>
<p>"Not at all. Isn't that enough for you? The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62" name="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
countess is saved. The count, not possessing the
least proof against her, is compelled by his mother
to forego the divorce and to give up the child.
That is all. Since then, he has left his wife,
who is living happily with her son, a fine lad of
sixteen."</p>
<p>"Yes ... yes ... but the way in which
the countess was saved?"</p>
<p>Lupin burst out laughing:</p>
<p>"My dear old chap"—Lupin sometimes condescends
to address me in this affectionate manner—"my
dear old chap, you may be rather smart at
relating my exploits, but, by Jove, you do want to
have the i's dotted for you! I assure you, the countess
did not ask for explanations!"</p>
<p>"Very likely. But there's no pride about me,"
I added, laughing. "Dot those i's for me, will
you?"</p>
<p>He took out a five-franc piece and closed his hand
over it.</p>
<p>"What's in my hand?"</p>
<p>"A five-franc piece."</p>
<p>He opened his hand. The five-franc piece was
gone.</p>
<p>"You see how easy it is! A working jeweller,
with his nippers, cuts a ring with a date engraved
upon it: 23rd of October. It's a simple little
trick of sleight-of-hand, one of many which I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63" name="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in my bag. By Jove, I didn't spend six months with
Dickson, the conjurer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> for nothing!"</p>
<p>"But then ...?"</p>
<p>"Out with it!"</p>
<p>"The working jeweller?"</p>
<p>"Was Horace Velmont! Was good old Lupin!
Leaving the countess at three o'clock in the morning,
I employed the few remaining minutes before the
husband's return to have a look round his study.
On the table I found the letter from the working
jeweller. The letter gave me the address. A bribe
of a few louis enabled me to take the workman's
place; and I arrived with a wedding-ring ready cut
and engraved. Hocus-pocus! Pass!... The
count couldn't make head or tail of it."</p>
<p>"Splendid!" I cried. And I added, a little chaffingly,
in my turn, "But don't you think that
you were humbugged a bit yourself, on this occasion?"</p>
<p>"Oh! And by whom, pray?"</p>
<p>"By the countess?"</p>
<p>"In what way?"</p>
<p>"Hang it all, that name engraved as a talisman!...
The mysterious Adonis who loved her
and suffered for her sake!... All that story
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64" name="Page_64">[64]</a></span>seems very unlikely; and I wonder whether, Lupin
though you be, you did not just drop upon a pretty
love-story, absolutely genuine and ... none too
innocent."</p>
<p>Lupin looked at me out of the corner of his eye:</p>
<p>"No," he said.</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"If the countess made a misstatement in telling
me that she knew that man before her marriage—and
that he was dead—and if she really did love
him in her secret heart, I, at least, have a positive
proof that it was an ideal love and that he did
not suspect it."</p>
<p>"And where is the proof?"</p>
<p>"It is inscribed inside the ring which I myself
broke on the countess's finger ... and which I
carry on me. Here it is. You can read the name she
had engraved on it."</p>
<p>He handed me the ring. I read:</p>
<p>"Horace Velmont."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence between Lupin
and myself; and, noticing it, I also observed on his
face a certain emotion, a tinge of melancholy.</p>
<p>I resumed:</p>
<p>"What made you tell me this story ... to
which you have often alluded in my presence?"</p>
<p>"What made me ...?"</p>
<p>He drew my attention to a woman, still ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65" name="Page_65">[65]</a></span>ceedingly
handsome, who was passing on a young
man's arm. She saw Lupin and bowed.</p>
<p>"It's she," he whispered. "She and her son."</p>
<p>"Then she recognized you?"</p>
<p>"She always recognizes me, whatever my disguise."</p>
<p>"But since the burglary at the Château de Thibermesnil,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a>
the police have identified the two names of
Arsène Lupin and Horace Velmont."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Therefore she knows who you are."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And she bows to you?" I exclaimed, in spite of
myself.</p>
<p>He caught me by the arm and, fiercely:</p>
<p>"Do you think that I am Lupin to her? Do you
think that I am a burglar in her eyes, a rogue, a
cheat?... Why, I might be the lowest of
miscreants, I might be a murderer even ... and
still she would bow to me!"</p>
<p>"Why? Because she loved you once?"</p>
<p>"Rot! That would be an additional reason, on
the contrary, why she should now despise me."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"I am the man who gave her back her son!"</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a id="III" name="III"></a>III</h2>
<h3 class="chapter2">THE SIGN OF THE SHADOW</h3>
<p>"I received your telegram and here I am," said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66" name="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a gentleman with a grey moustache, who entered
my study, dressed in a dark-brown frock-coat and
a wide-brimmed hat, with a red ribbon in his
buttonhole. "What's the matter?"</p>
<p>Had I not been expecting Arsène Lupin, I should
certainly never have recognized him in the person
of this old half-pay officer:</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" I echoed. "Oh, nothing
much: a rather curious coincidence, that's all.
And, as I know that you would just as soon clear
up a mystery as plan one...."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"You seem in a great hurry!"</p>
<p>"I am ... unless the mystery in question is
worth putting myself out for. So let us get to the
point."</p>
<p>"Very well. Just begin by casting your eye on
this little picture, which I picked up, a week or
two ago, in a grimy old shop on the other side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67" name="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the river. I bought it for the sake of its Empire
frame, with the palm-leaf ornaments on the
mouldings ... for the painting is execrable."</p>
<p>"Execrable, as you say," said Lupin, after he
had examined it, "but the subject itself is rather
nice. That corner of an old courtyard, with its
rotunda of Greek columns, its sun-dial and its
fish-pond and that ruined well with the Renascence
roof and those stone steps and stone benches: all
very picturesque."</p>
<p>"And genuine," I added. "The picture, good
or bad, has never been taken out of its Empire
frame. Besides, it is dated.... There, in the
left-hand bottom corner: those red figures, 15. 4. 2,
which obviously stand for 15 April, 1802."</p>
<p>"I dare say ... I dare say.... But
you were speaking of a coincidence and, so far, I
fail to see...."</p>
<p>I went to a corner of my study, took a telescope,
fixed it on its stand and pointed it, through the
open window, at the open window of a little room
facing my flat, on the other side of the street. And
I asked Lupin to look through it.</p>
<p>He stooped forward. The slanting rays of the
morning sun lit up the room opposite, revealing
a set of mahogany furniture, all very simple, a
large bed and a child's bed hung with cretonne
curtains.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68" name="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah!" cried Lupin, suddenly. "The same
picture!"</p>
<p>"Exactly the same!" I said. "And the date:
do you see the date, in red? 15. 4. 2."</p>
<p>"Yes, I see.... And who lives in that room?"</p>
<p>"A lady ... or, rather, a workwoman,
for she has to work for her living ... needlework,
hardly enough to keep herself and her child."</p>
<p>"What is her name?"</p>
<p>"Louise d'Ernemont.... From what I
hear, she is the great-granddaughter of a farmer-general
who was guillotined during the Terror."</p>
<p>"Yes, on the same day as André Chénier," said
Lupin. "According to the memoirs of the time,
this d'Ernemont was supposed to be a very rich
man." He raised his head and said, "It's an
interesting story.... Why did you wait before
telling me?"</p>
<p>"Because this is the 15th of April."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well, I discovered yesterday—I heard them
talking about it in the porter's box—that the 15th
of April plays an important part in the life of
Louise d'Ernemont."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Contrary to her usual habits, this woman who
works every day of her life, who keeps her two
rooms tidy, who cooks the lunch which her little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69" name="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
girl eats when she comes home from the parish
school ... this woman, on the 15th of April, goes
out with the child at ten o'clock in the morning
and does not return until nightfall. And this has
happened for years and in all weathers. You must
admit that there is something queer about this date
which I find on an old picture, which is inscribed
on another, similar picture and which controls the
annual movements of the descendant of d'Ernemont
the farmer-general."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's curious ... you're quite right," said
Lupin, slowly. "And don't you know where she
goes to?"</p>
<p>"Nobody knows. She does not confide in a
soul. As a matter of fact, she talks very little."</p>
<p>"Are you sure of your information?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. And the best proof of its accuracy
is that here she comes."</p>
<p>A door had opened at the back of the room
opposite, admitting a little girl of seven or eight,
who came and looked out of the window. A lady
appeared behind her, tall, good-looking still and
wearing a sad and gentle air. Both of them were
ready and dressed, in clothes which were simple
in themselves, but which pointed to a love of
neatness and a certain elegance on the part of the
mother.</p>
<p>"You see," I whispered, "they are going out."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70" name="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>And presently the mother took the child by the
hand and they left the room together.</p>
<p>Lupin caught up his hat:</p>
<p>"Are you coming?"</p>
<p>My curiosity was too great for me to raise the
least objection. I went downstairs with Lupin.</p>
<p>As we stepped into the street, we saw my neighbour
enter a baker's shop. She bought two rolls
and placed them in a little basket which her
daughter was carrying and which seemed already
to contain some other provisions. Then they went
in the direction of the outer boulevards and followed
them as far as the Place de l'Étoile, where
they turned down the Avenue Kléber to walk toward
Passy.</p>
<p>Lupin strolled silently along, evidently obsessed
by a train of thought which I was glad to have
provoked. From time to time, he uttered a sentence
which showed me the thread of his reflections; and
I was able to see that the riddle remained as much
a mystery to him as to myself.</p>
<p>Louise d'Ernemont, meanwhile, had branched
off to the left, along the Rue Raynouard, a quiet
old street in which Franklin and Balzac once
lived, one of those streets which, lined with old-fashioned
houses and walled gardens, give you the
impression of being in a country-town. The Seine
flows at the foot of the slope which the street<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71" name="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
crowns; and a number of lanes run down to the
river.</p>
<p>My neighbour took one of these narrow, winding,
deserted lanes. The first building, on the right,
was a house the front of which faced the Rue Raynouard.
Next came a moss-grown wall, of a
height above the ordinary, supported by buttresses
and bristling with broken glass.</p>
<p>Half-way along the wall was a low, arched door.
Louise d'Ernemont stopped in front of this door
and opened it with a key which seemed to us enormous.
Mother and child entered and closed the
door.</p>
<p>"In any case," said Lupin, "she has nothing to
conceal, for she has not looked round once...."</p>
<p>He had hardly finished his sentence when we
heard the sound of footsteps behind us. It was
two old beggars, a man and a woman, tattered,
dirty, squalid, covered in rags. They passed us
without paying the least attention to our presence.
The man took from his wallet a key similar to my
neighbour's and put it into the lock. The door
closed behind them.</p>
<p>And, suddenly, at the top of the lane, came the
noise of a motor-car stopping.... Lupin dragged
me fifty yards lower down, to a corner in which we
were able to hide. And we saw coming down the
lane, carrying a little dog under her arm, a young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72" name="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and very much over-dressed woman, wearing a
quantity of jewellery, a young woman whose eyes
were too dark, her lips too red, her hair too fair.
In front of the door, the same performance, with
the same key.... The lady and the dog disappeared
from view.</p>
<p>"This promises to be most amusing," said
Lupin, chuckling. "What earthly connection can
there be between those different people?"</p>
<p>There hove in sight successively two elderly
ladies, lean and rather poverty-stricken in appearance,
very much alike, evidently sisters; a footman
in livery; an infantry corporal; a fat gentleman
in a soiled and patched jacket-suit; and, lastly,
a workman's family, father, mother, and four
children, all six of them pale and sickly, looking
like people who never eat their fill. And each of
the newcomers carried a basket or string-bag
filled with provisions.</p>
<p>"It's a picnic!" I cried.</p>
<p>"It grows more and more surprising," said
Lupin, "and I sha'n't be satisfied till I know what
is happening behind that wall."</p>
<p>To climb it was out of the question. We also
saw that it finished, at the lower as well as at the
upper end, at a house none of whose windows
overlooked the enclosure which the wall contained.</p>
<p>During the next hour, no one else came along.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73" name="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
We vainly cast about for a stratagem; and Lupin,
whose fertile brain had exhausted every possible
expedient, was about to go in search of a ladder,
when, suddenly, the little door opened and one
of the workman's children came out.</p>
<p>The boy ran up the lane to the Rue Raynouard.
A few minutes later he returned, carrying two
bottles of water, which he set down on the pavement
to take the big key from his pocket.</p>
<p>By that time Lupin had left me and was strolling
slowly along the wall. When the child, after
entering the enclosure, pushed back the door
Lupin sprang forward and stuck the point of his
knife into the staple of the lock. The bolt failed
to catch; and it became an easy matter to push
the door ajar.</p>
<p>"That's done the trick!" said Lupin.</p>
<p>He cautiously put his hand through the doorway
and then, to my great surprise, entered boldly.
But, on following his example, I saw that, ten
yards behind the wall, a clump of laurels formed a
sort of curtain which allowed us to come up unobserved.</p>
<p>Lupin took his stand right in the middle of the
clump. I joined him and, like him, pushed aside
the branches of one of the shrubs. And the
sight which presented itself to my eyes was so
unexpected that I was unable to suppress an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74" name="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
exclamation, while Lupin, on his side, muttered,
between his teeth:</p>
<p>"By Jupiter! This is a funny job!"</p>
<p>We saw before us, within the confined space
that lay between the two windowless houses, the
identical scene represented in the old picture which
I had bought at a second-hand dealer's!</p>
<p>The identical scene! At the back, against the
opposite wall, the same Greek rotunda displayed
its slender columns. In the middle, the same
stone benches topped a circle of four steps that
ran down to a fish-pond with moss-grown flags.
On the left, the same well raised its wrought-iron
roof; and, close at hand, the same sun-dial showed
its slanting gnomon and its marble face.</p>
<p>The identical scene! And what added to the
strangeness of the sight was the memory, obsessing
Lupin and myself, of that date of the 15th of
April, inscribed in a corner of the picture, and the
thought that this very day was the 15th of April
and that sixteen or seventeen people, so different
in age, condition and manners, had chosen the
15th of April to come together in this forgotten
corner of Paris!</p>
<p>All of them, at the moment when we caught
sight of them, were sitting in separate groups on
the benches and steps; and all were eating. Not
very far from my neighbour and her daughter, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75" name="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
workman's family and the beggar couple were
sharing their provisions; while the footman, the
gentleman in the soiled suit, the infantry corporal
and the two lean sisters were making a common
stock of their sliced ham, their tins of sardines
and their gruyère cheese.</p>
<p>The lady with the little dog alone, who had
brought no food with her, sat apart from the
others, who made a show of turning their backs
upon her. But Louise d'Ernemont offered her
a sandwich, whereupon her example was followed
by the two sisters; and the corporal at once began
to make himself as agreeable to the young person
as he could.</p>
<p>It was now half-past one. The beggar-man took
out his pipe, as did the fat gentleman; and, when
they found that one had no tobacco and the other
no matches, their needs soon brought them together.
The men went and smoked by the rotunda
and the women joined them. For that matter, all
these people seemed to know one another quite
well.</p>
<p>They were at some distance from where we were
standing, so that we could not hear what they
said. However, we gradually perceived that the
conversation was becoming animated. The young
person with the dog, in particular, who by this
time appeared to be in great request, indulged in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76" name="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
much voluble talk, accompanying her words with
many gestures, which set the little dog barking
furiously.</p>
<p>But, suddenly, there was an outcry, promptly
followed by shouts of rage; and one and all,
men and women alike, rushed in disorder toward
the well. One of the workman's brats was at that
moment coming out of it, fastened by his belt to
the hook at the end of the rope; and the three
other urchins were drawing him up by turning
the handle. More active than the rest, the corporal
flung himself upon him; and forthwith the footman
and the fat gentleman seized hold of him also, while
the beggars and the lean sisters came to blows
with the workman and his family.</p>
<p>In a few seconds the little boy had not a stitch
left on him beyond his shirt. The footman, who
had taken possession of the rest of the clothes,
ran away, pursued by the corporal, who snatched
away the boy's breeches, which were next torn
from the corporal by one of the lean sisters.</p>
<p>"They are mad!" I muttered, feeling absolutely
at sea.</p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all," said Lupin.</p>
<p>"What! Do you mean to say that you can
make head or tail of what is going on?"</p>
<p>He did not reply. The young lady with the
little dog, tucking her pet under her arm, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77" name="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
started running after the child in the shirt, who
uttered loud yells. The two of them raced round
the laurel-clump in which we stood hidden; and
the brat flung himself into his mother's arms.</p>
<p>At long last, Louise d'Ernemont, who had
played a conciliatory part from the beginning,
succeeded in allaying the tumult. Everybody sat
down again; but there was a reaction in all those
exasperated people and they remained motionless
and silent, as though worn out with their exertions.</p>
<p>And time went by. Losing patience and beginning
to feel the pangs of hunger, I went to the
Rue Raynouard to fetch something to eat, which
we divided while watching the actors in the incomprehensible
comedy that was being performed
before our eyes. They hardly stirred. Each
minute that passed seemed to load them with
increasing melancholy; and they sank into attitudes
of discouragement, bent their backs more
and more and sat absorbed in their meditations.</p>
<p>The afternoon wore on in this way, under a grey
sky that shed a dreary light over the enclosure.</p>
<p>"Are they going to spend the night here?" I
asked, in a bored voice.</p>
<p>But, at five o'clock or so, the fat gentleman
in the soiled jacket-suit took out his watch. The
others did the same and all, watch in hand, seemed
to be anxiously awaiting an event of no little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78" name="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
importance to themselves. The event did not take
place, for, in fifteen or twenty minutes, the fat gentleman
gave a gesture of despair, stood up and put
on his hat.</p>
<p>Then lamentations broke forth. The two lean
sisters and the workman's wife fell upon their
knees and made the sign of the cross. The lady
with the little dog and the beggar-woman kissed
each other and sobbed; and we saw Louise d'Ernemont
pressing her daughter sadly to her.</p>
<p>"Let's go," said Lupin.</p>
<p>"You think it's over?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and we have only just time to make
ourselves scarce."</p>
<p>We went out unmolested. At the top of the
lane, Lupin turned to the left and, leaving me
outside, entered the first house in the Rue Raynouard,
the one that backed on to the enclosure.</p>
<p>After talking for a few seconds to the porter,
he joined me and we stopped a passing taxi-cab:</p>
<p>"No. 34 Rue de Turin," he said to the driver.</p>
<p>The ground-floor of No. 34 was occupied by a
notary's office; and we were shown in, almost
without waiting, to Maître Valandier, a smiling,
pleasant-spoken man of a certain age.</p>
<p>Lupin introduced himself by the name of Captain
Jeanniot, retired from the army. He said that
he wanted to build a house to his own liking and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79" name="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that some one had suggested to him a plot of
ground situated near the Rue Raynouard.</p>
<p>"But that plot is not for sale," said Maître
Valandier.</p>
<p>"Oh, I was told...."</p>
<p>"You have been misinformed, I fear."</p>
<p>The lawyer rose, went to a cupboard and returned
with a picture which he showed us. I was petrified.
It was the same picture which I had bought, the
same picture that hung in Louise d'Ernemont's
room.</p>
<p>"This is a painting," he said, "of the plot of
ground to which you refer. It is known as the
Clos d'Ernemont."</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"Well, this close," continued the notary, "once
formed part of a large garden belonging to d'Ernemont,
the farmer-general, who was executed during
the Terror. All that could be sold has been sold,
piecemeal, by the heirs. But this last plot has
remained and will remain in their joint possession
... unless...."</p>
<p>The notary began to laugh.</p>
<p>"Unless what?" asked Lupin.</p>
<p>"Well, it's quite a romance, a rather curious
romance, in fact. I often amuse myself by looking
through the voluminous documents of the case."</p>
<p>"Would it be indiscreet, if I asked ...?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80" name="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all," declared Maître Valandier,
who seemed delighted, on the contrary, to have
found a listener for his story. And, without
waiting to be pressed, he began: "At the outbreak
of the Revolution, Louis Agrippa d'Ernemont, on
the pretence of joining his wife, who was staying
at Geneva with their daughter Pauline, shut up
his mansion in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, dismissed
his servants and, with his son Charles, came
and took up his abode in his pleasure-house at
Passy, where he was known to nobody except an
old and devoted serving-woman. He remained there
in hiding for three years and he had every reason
to hope that his retreat would not be discovered,
when, one day, after luncheon, as he was having
a nap, the old servant burst into his room. She
had seen, at the end of the street, a patrol of armed
men who seemed to be making for the house. Louis
d'Ernemont got ready quickly and, at the moment
when the men were knocking at the front door,
disappeared through the door that led to the garden,
shouting to his son, in a scared voice, to keep
them talking, if only for five minutes. He may
have intended to escape and found the outlets
through the garden watched. In any case, he
returned in six or seven minutes, replied very
calmly to the questions put to him and raised no
difficulty about accompanying the men. His son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81" name="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Charles, although only eighteen years of age, was
arrested also."</p>
<p>"When did this happen?" asked Lupin.</p>
<p>"It happened on the 26th day of Germinal,
Year II, that is to say, on the...."</p>
<p>Maître Valandier stopped, with his eyes fixed
on a calendar that hung on the wall, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Why, it was on this very day! This is the
15th of April, the anniversary of the farmer-general's
arrest."</p>
<p>"What an odd coincidence!" said Lupin. "And
considering the period at which it took place, the
arrest, no doubt, had serious consequences?"</p>
<p>"Oh, most serious!" said the notary, laughing.
"Three months later, at the beginning of Thermidor,
the farmer-general mounted the scaffold. His son
Charles was forgotten in prison and their property
was confiscated."</p>
<p>"The property was immense, I suppose?" said
Lupin.</p>
<p>"Well, there you are! That's just where the
thing becomes complicated. The property, which
was, in fact, immense, could never be traced. It
was discovered that the Faubourg Saint-Germain
mansion had been sold, before the Revolution, to an
Englishman, together with all the country-seats and
estates and all the jewels, securities and collections
belonging to the farmer-general. The Convention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82" name="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
instituted minute inquiries, as did the Directory
afterward. But the inquiries led to no result."</p>
<p>"There remained, at any rate, the Passy house,"
said Lupin.</p>
<p>"The house at Passy was bought, for a mere
song, by a delegate of the Commune, the very
man who had arrested d'Ernemont, one Citizen
Broquet. Citizen Broquet shut himself up in the
house, barricaded the doors, fortified the walls
and, when Charles d'Ernemont was at last set
free and appeared outside, received him by firing
a musket at him. Charles instituted one law-suit
after another, lost them all and then proceeded to
offer large sums of money. But Citizen Broquet
proved intractable. He had bought the house
and he stuck to the house; and he would have
stuck to it until his death, if Charles had not obtained
the support of Bonaparte. Citizen Broquet
cleared out on the 12th of February, 1803; but
Charles d'Ernemont's joy was so great and his
brain, no doubt, had been so violently unhinged
by all that he had gone through, that, on reaching
the threshold of the house of which he had at last
recovered the ownership, even before opening the
door he began to dance and sing in the street. He
had gone clean off his head."</p>
<p>"By Jove!" said Lupin. "And what became
of him?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83" name="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>"His mother and his sister Pauline, who had
ended by marrying a cousin of the same name at
Geneva, were both dead. The old servant-woman
took care of him and they lived together in the
Passy house. Years passed without any notable
event; but, suddenly, in 1812, an unexpected
incident happened. The old servant made a
series of strange revelations on her death-bed, in
the presence of two witnesses whom she sent for.
She declared that the farmer-general had carried
to his house at Passy a number of bags filled with
gold and silver and that those bags had disappeared
a few days before the arrest. According to earlier
confidences made by Charles d'Ernemont, who
had them from his father, the treasures were hidden
in the garden, between the rotunda, the sun-dial
and the well. In proof of her statement, she
produced three pictures, or rather, for they were
not yet framed, three canvases, which the farmer-general
had painted during his captivity and which
he had succeeded in conveying to her, with instructions
to hand them to his wife, his son and
his daughter. Tempted by the lure of wealth,
Charles and the old servant had kept silence. Then
came the law-suits, the recovery of the house,
Charles's madness, the servant's own useless searches;
and the treasures were still there."</p>
<p>"And they are there now," chuckled Lupin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84" name="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>"And they will be there always," exclaimed
Maître Valandier. "Unless ... unless Citizen
Broquet, who no doubt smelt a rat, succeeded
in ferreting them out. But this is an unlikely
supposition, for Citizen Broquet died in extreme
poverty."</p>
<p>"So then ...?"</p>
<p>"So then everybody began to hunt. The
children of Pauline, the sister, hastened from
Geneva. It was discovered that Charles had been
secretly married and that he had sons. All these
heirs set to work."</p>
<p>"But Charles himself?"</p>
<p>"Charles lived in the most absolute retirement.
He did not leave his room."</p>
<p>"Never?"</p>
<p>"Well, that is the most extraordinary, the most
astounding part of the story. Once a year, Charles
d'Ernemont, impelled by a sort of subconscious
will-power, came downstairs, took the exact road
which his father had taken, walked across the
garden and sat down either on the steps of the
rotunda, which you see here, in the picture, or
on the kerb of the well. At twenty-seven minutes
past five, he rose and went indoors again; and
until his death, which occurred in 1820, he never
once failed to perform this incomprehensible pilgrimage.
Well, the day on which this happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85" name="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was invariably the 15th of April, the anniversary
of the arrest."</p>
<p>Maître Valandier was no longer smiling and
himself seemed impressed by the amazing story
which he was telling us.</p>
<p>"And, since Charles's death?" asked Lupin,
after a moment's reflection.</p>
<p>"Since that time," replied the lawyer, with a
certain solemnity of manner, "for nearly a hundred
years, the heirs of Charles and Pauline d'Ernemont
have kept up the pilgrimage of the 15th of April.
During the first few years they made the most
thorough excavations. Every inch of the garden
was searched, every clod of ground dug up. All
this is now over. They take hardly any pains.
All they do is, from time to time, for no particular
reason, to turn over a stone or explore the
well. For the most part, they are content to sit
down on the steps of the rotunda, like the poor
madman; and, like him, they wait. And that,
you see, is the sad part of their destiny. In those
hundred years, all these people who have succeeded
one another, from father to son, have lost—what
shall I say?—the energy of life. They have no
courage left, no initiative. They wait. They wait
for the 15th of April; and, when the 15th of April
comes, they wait for a miracle to take place.
Poverty has ended by overtaking every one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86" name="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
them. My predecessors and I have sold first the
house, in order to build another which yields a
better rent, followed by bits of the garden and
further bits. But, as to that corner over there,"
pointing to the picture, "they would rather die
than sell it. On this they are all agreed: Louise
d'Ernemont, who is the direct heiress of Pauline,
as well as the beggars, the workman, the footman,
the circus-rider and so on, who represent the
unfortunate Charles."</p>
<p>There was a fresh pause; and Lupin asked:</p>
<p>"What is your own opinion, Maître Valandier?"</p>
<p>"My private opinion is that there's nothing in
it. What credit can we give to the statements of
an old servant enfeebled by age? What importance
can we attach to the crotchets of a madman?
Besides, if the farmer-general had realized his
fortune, don't you think that that fortune would
have been found? One could manage to hide a
paper, a document, in a confined space like that,
but not treasures."</p>
<p>"Still, the pictures?..."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. But, after all, are they a
sufficient proof?"</p>
<p>Lupin bent over the copy which the solicitor had
taken from the cupboard and, after examining it
at length, said:</p>
<p>"You spoke of three pictures."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87" name="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, the one which you see was handed to my
predecessor by the heirs of Charles. Louise d'Ernemont
possesses another. As for the third, no one
knows what became of it."</p>
<p>Lupin looked at me and continued:</p>
<p>"And do they all bear the same date?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the date inscribed by Charles d'Ernemont
when he had them framed, not long before his
death.... The same date, that is to say the
15th of April, Year II, according to the revolutionary
calendar, as the arrest took place in April, 1794."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, of course," said Lupin. "The figure
2 means...."</p>
<p>He thought for a few moments and resumed:</p>
<p>"One more question, if I may. Did no one ever
come forward to solve the problem?"</p>
<p>Maître Valandier threw up his arms:</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious me!" he cried. "Why,
it was the plague of the office! One of my predecessors,
Maître Turbon, was summoned to Passy no
fewer than eighteen times, between 1820 and 1843,
by the groups of heirs, whom fortune-tellers,
clairvoyants, visionaries, impostors of all sorts had
promised that they would discover the farmer-general's
treasures. At last, we laid down a rule:
any outsider applying to institute a search was to
begin by depositing a certain sum."</p>
<p>"What sum?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88" name="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>"A thousand francs."</p>
<p>"And did this have the effect of frightening them
off?"</p>
<p>"No. Four years ago, an Hungarian hypnotist
tried the experiment and made me waste a whole
day. After that, we fixed the deposit at five thousand
francs. In case of success, a third of the treasure
goes to the finder. In case of failure, the deposit
is forfeited to the heirs. Since then, I have been
left in peace."</p>
<p>"Here are your five thousand francs."</p>
<p>The lawyer gave a start:</p>
<p>"Eh? What do you say?"</p>
<p>"I say," repeated Lupin, taking five bank-notes
from his pocket and calmly spreading them on
the table, "I say that here is the deposit of five
thousand francs. Please give me a receipt and
invite all the d'Ernemont heirs to meet me at Passy
on the 15th of April next year."</p>
<p>The notary could not believe his senses. I myself,
although Lupin had accustomed me to these surprises,
was utterly taken back.</p>
<p>"Are you serious?" asked Maître Valandier.</p>
<p>"Perfectly serious."</p>
<p>"But, you know, I told you my opinion. All
these improbable stories rest upon no evidence of
any kind."</p>
<p>"I don't agree with you," said Lupin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89" name="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>The notary gave him the look which we give
to a person who is not quite right in his head. Then,
accepting the situation, he took his pen and drew
up a contract on stamped paper, acknowledging
the payment of the deposit by Captain Jeanniot and
promising him a third of such moneys as he should
discover:</p>
<p>"If you change your mind," he added, "you might
let me know a week before the time comes. I
shall not inform the d'Ernemont family until the
last moment, so as not to give those poor people
too long a spell of hope."</p>
<p>"You can inform them this very day, Maître
Valandier. It will make them spend a happier year."</p>
<p>We said good-bye. Outside, in the street, I cried:</p>
<p>"So you have hit upon something?"</p>
<p>"I?" replied Lupin. "Not a bit of it! And
that's just what amuses me."</p>
<p>"But they have been searching for a hundred
years!"</p>
<p>"It is not so much a matter of searching as of
thinking. Now I have three hundred and sixty-five
days to think in. It is a great deal more than
I want; and I am afraid that I shall forget all about
the business, interesting though it may be. Oblige
me by reminding me, will you?"</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>I reminded him of it several times during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90" name="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
following months, though he never seemed to attach
much importance to the matter. Then came a
long period during which I had no opportunity
of seeing him. It was the period, as I afterward
learnt, of his visit to Armenia and of the terrible
struggle on which he embarked against Abdul the
Damned, a struggle which ended in the tyrant's
downfall.</p>
<p>I used to write to him, however, at the address
which he gave me and I was thus able to send him
certain particulars which I had succeeded in gathering,
here and there, about my neighbour Louise
d'Ernemont, such as the love which she had conceived,
a few years earlier, for a very rich young
man, who still loved her, but who had been compelled
by his family to throw her over; the young
widow's despair, and the plucky life which she led
with her little daughter.</p>
<p>Lupin replied to none of my letters. I did not
know whether they reached him; and, meantime,
the date was drawing near and I could not help
wondering whether his numerous undertakings would
not prevent him from keeping the appointment
which he himself had fixed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the morning of the 15th of
April arrived and Lupin was not with me by the
time I had finished lunch. It was a quarter-past
twelve. I left my flat and took a cab to Passy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91" name="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>I had no sooner entered the lane than I saw the
workman's four brats standing outside the door in
the wall. Maître Valandier, informed by them of
my arrival, hastened in my direction:</p>
<p>"Well?" he cried. "Where's Captain Jeanniot?"</p>
<p>"Hasn't he come?"</p>
<p>"No; and I can assure you that everybody is
very impatient to see him."</p>
<p>The different groups began to crowd round the
lawyer; and I noticed that all those faces which
I recognized had thrown off the gloomy and despondent
expression which they wore a year ago.</p>
<p>"They are full of hope," said Maître Valandier,
"and it is my fault. But what could I do? Your
friend made such an impression upon me that I
spoke to these good people with a confidence ...
which I cannot say I feel. However, he seems a
queer sort of fellow, this Captain Jeanniot of
yours...."</p>
<p>He asked me many questions and I gave him a
number of more or less fanciful details about the
captain, to which the heirs listened, nodding their
heads in appreciation of my remarks.</p>
<p>"Of course, the truth was bound to be discovered
sooner or later," said the fat gentleman, in a tone
of conviction.</p>
<p>The infantry corporal, dazzled by the captain's
rank, did not entertain a doubt in his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92" name="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>The lady with the little dog wanted to know if
Captain Jeanniot was young.</p>
<p>But Louise d'Ernemont said:</p>
<p>"And suppose he does not come?"</p>
<p>"We shall still have the five thousand francs
to divide," said the beggar-man.</p>
<p>For all that, Louise d'Ernemont's words had
damped their enthusiasm. Their faces began to
look sullen and I felt an atmosphere as of anguish
weighing upon us.</p>
<p>At half-past one, the two lean sisters felt faint
and sat down. Then the fat gentleman in the
soiled suit suddenly rounded on the notary:</p>
<p>"It's you, Maître Valandier, who are to blame....
You ought to have brought the captain here
by main force.... He's a humbug, that's quite
clear."</p>
<p>He gave me a savage look, and the footman, in
his turn, flung muttered curses at me.</p>
<p>I confess that their reproaches seemed to me
well-founded and that Lupin's absence annoyed me
greatly:</p>
<p>"He won't come now," I whispered to the lawyer.</p>
<p>And I was thinking of beating a retreat, when the
eldest of the brats appeared at the door, yelling:</p>
<p>"There's some one coming!... A motor-cycle!..."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93" name="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>A motor was throbbing on the other side of the
wall. A man on a motor-bicycle came tearing
down the lane at the risk of breaking his neck.
Suddenly, he put on his brakes, outside the door,
and sprang from his machine.</p>
<p>Under the layer of dust which covered him from
head to foot, we could see that his navy-blue reefer-suit,
his carefully creased trousers, his black felt
hat and patent-leather boots were not the clothes
in which a man usually goes cycling.</p>
<p>"But that's not Captain Jeanniot!" shouted the
notary, who failed to recognize him.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is," said Lupin, shaking hands with
us. "I'm Captain Jeanniot right enough ...
only I've shaved off my moustache.... Besides,
Maître Valandier, here's your receipt."</p>
<p>He caught one of the workman's children by the
arm and said:</p>
<p>"Run to the cab-rank and fetch a taxi to the
corner of the Rue Raynouard. Look sharp! I
have an urgent appointment to keep at two o'clock,
or a quarter-past at the latest."</p>
<p>There was a murmur of protest. Captain Jeanniot
took out his watch:</p>
<p>"Well! It's only twelve minutes to two! I have
a good quarter of an hour before me. But, by
Jingo, how tired I feel! And how hungry into
the bargain!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94" name="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>The corporal thrust his ammunition-bread into
Lupin's hand; and he munched away at it as he
sat down and said:</p>
<p>"You must forgive me. I was in the Marseilles
express, which left the rails between Dijon and
Laroche. There were twelve people killed and any
number injured, whom I had to help. Then I
found this motor-cycle in the luggage-van....
Maître Valandier, you must be good enough to restore
it to the owner. You will find the label fastened
to the handle-bar. Ah, you're back, my boy! Is
the taxi there? At the corner of the Rue Raynouard?
Capital!"</p>
<p>He looked at his watch again:</p>
<p>"Hullo! No time to lose!"</p>
<p>I stared at him with eager curiosity. But how
great must the excitement of the d'Ernemont heirs
have been! True, they had not the same faith
in Captain Jeanniot that I had in Lupin. Nevertheless,
their faces were pale and drawn. Captain
Jeanniot turned slowly to the left and walked up
to the sun-dial. The pedestal represented the figure
of a man with a powerful torso, who bore on his
shoulders a marble slab the surface of which had
been so much worn by time that we could hardly
distinguish the engraved lines that marked the
hours. Above the slab, a Cupid, with outspread
wings, held an arrow that served as a gnomon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95" name="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>The captain stood leaning forward for a minute,
with attentive eyes.</p>
<p>Then he said:</p>
<p>"Somebody lend me a knife, please."</p>
<p>A clock in the neighbourhood struck two. At
that exact moment, the shadow of the arrow was
thrown upon the sunlit dial along the line of a crack
in the marble which divided the slab very nearly
in half.</p>
<p>The captain took the knife handed to him. And
with the point, very gently, he began to scratch
the mixture of earth and moss that filled the narrow
cleft.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, at a couple of inches from
the edge, he stopped, as though his knife had encountered
an obstacle, inserted his thumb and forefinger
and withdrew a small object which he rubbed
between the palms of his hands and gave to the
lawyer:</p>
<p>"Here, Maître Valandier. Something to go on
with."</p>
<p>It was an enormous diamond, the size of a hazelnut
and beautifully cut.</p>
<p>The captain resumed his work. The next moment,
a fresh stop. A second diamond, magnificent and
brilliant as the first, appeared in sight.</p>
<p>And then came a third and a fourth.</p>
<p>In a minute's time, following the crack from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96" name="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
one edge to the other and certainly without digging
deeper than half an inch, the captain had taken
out eighteen diamonds of the same size.</p>
<p>During this minute, there was not a cry, not a
movement around the sun-dial. The heirs seemed
paralyzed with a sort of stupor. Then the fat
gentleman muttered:</p>
<p>"Geminy!"</p>
<p>And the corporal moaned:</p>
<p>"Oh, captain!... Oh, captain!..."</p>
<p>The two sisters fell in a dead faint. The lady
with the little dog dropped on her knees and prayed,
while the footman, staggering like a drunken man,
held his head in his two hands, and Louise d'Ernemont
wept.</p>
<p>When calm was restored and all became eager to
thank Captain Jeanniot, they saw that he was gone.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>Some years passed before I had an opportunity
of talking to Lupin about this business. He was
in a confidential vein and answered:</p>
<p>"The business of the eighteen diamonds? By
Jove, when I think that three or four generations
of my fellow-men had been hunting for the solution!
And the eighteen diamonds were there all the time,
under a little mud and dust!"</p>
<p>"But how did you guess?..."</p>
<p>"I did not guess. I reflected. I doubt if I need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97" name="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
even have reflected. I was struck, from the beginning,
by the fact that the whole circumstance
was governed by one primary question: the question
of time. When Charles d'Ernemont was still
in possession of his wits, he wrote a date upon the
three pictures. Later, in the gloom in which he
was struggling, a faint glimmer of intelligence led
him every year to the centre of the old garden;
and the same faint glimmer led him away from it
every year at the same moment, that is to say, at
twenty-seven minutes past five. Something must
have acted on the disordered machinery of his brain
in this way. What was the superior force that
controlled the poor madman's movements? Obviously,
the instinctive notion of time represented
by the sun-dial in the farmer-general's pictures.
It was the annual revolution of the earth around
the sun that brought Charles d'Ernemont back
to the garden at a fixed date. And it was the earth's
daily revolution upon its own axis that took him from
it at a fixed hour, that is to say, at the hour, most
likely, when the sun, concealed by objects different
from those of to-day, ceased to light the Passy
garden. Now of all this the sun-dial was the symbol.
And that is why I at once knew where to
look."</p>
<p>"But how did you settle the hour at which to
begin looking?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98" name="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>"Simply by the pictures. A man living at that
time, such as Charles d'Ernemont, would have
written either 26 Germinal, Year II, or else 15 April,
1794, but not 15 April, Year II. I was astounded
that no one had thought of that."</p>
<p>"Then the figure 2 stood for two o'clock?"</p>
<p>"Evidently. And what must have happened was
this: the farmer-general began by turning his
fortune into solid gold and silver money. Then,
by way of additional precaution, with this gold
and silver he bought eighteen wonderful diamonds.
When he was surprised by the arrival of the patrol,
he fled into his garden. Which was the best place
to hide the diamonds? Chance caused his eyes to
light upon the sun-dial. It was two o'clock. The
shadow of the arrow was then falling along the crack
in the marble. He obeyed this sign of the shadow,
rammed his eighteen diamonds into the dust and
calmly went back and surrendered to the soldiers."</p>
<p>"But the shadow of the arrow coincides with
the crack in the marble every day of the year and
not only on the 15th of April."</p>
<p>"You forget, my dear chap, that we are dealing
with a lunatic and that he remembered only this
date of the 15th of April."</p>
<p>"Very well; but you, once you had solved the
riddle, could easily have made your way into the
enclosure and taken the diamonds."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99" name="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>"Quite true; and I should not have hesitated,
if I had had to do with people of another description.
But I really felt sorry for those poor wretches.
And then you know the sort of idiot that Lupin is.
The idea of appearing suddenly as a benevolent
genius and amazing his kind would be enough to
make him commit any sort of folly."</p>
<p>"Tah!" I cried. "The folly was not so great
as all that. Six magnificent diamonds! How delighted
the d'Ernemont heirs must have been to
fulfil their part of the contract!"</p>
<p>Lupin looked at me and burst into uncontrollable
laughter:</p>
<p>"So you haven't heard? Oh, what a joke! The
delight of the d'Ernemont heirs!.... Why, my
dear fellow, on the next day, that worthy Captain
Jeanniot had so many mortal enemies! On the very
next day, the two lean sisters and the fat gentleman
organized an opposition. A contract? Not worth
the paper it was written on, because, as could easily
be proved, there was no such person as Captain
Jeanniot. Where did that adventurer spring from?
Just let him sue them and they'd soon show him
what was what!"</p>
<p>"Louise d'Ernemont too?"</p>
<p>"No, Louise d'Ernemont protested against that
piece of rascality. But what could she do against
so many? Besides, now that she was rich, she got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100" name="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
back her young man. I haven't heard of her
since."</p>
<p>"So ...?"</p>
<p>"So, my dear fellow, I was caught in a trap, with
not a leg to stand on, and I had to compromise
and accept one modest diamond as my share, the
smallest and the least handsome of the lot. That
comes of doing one's best to help people!"</p>
<p>And Lupin grumbled between his teeth:</p>
<p>"Oh, gratitude!... All humbug!... Where
should we honest men be if we had not our conscience
and the satisfaction of duty performed to
reward us?"</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="chapter"><a id="IV" name="IV"></a>IV</h2>
<h3 class="chapter2">THE INFERNAL TRAP</h3>
<p>When the race was over, a crowd of people, streaming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101" name="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
toward the exit from the grand stand, pushed
against Nicolas Dugrival. He brought his hand
smartly to the inside pocket of his jacket.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" asked his wife.</p>
<p>"I still feel nervous ... with that money
on me! I'm afraid of some nasty accident."</p>
<p>She muttered:</p>
<p>"And I can't understand you. How can you
think of carrying such a sum about with you?
Every farthing we possess! Lord knows, it cost
us trouble enough to earn!"</p>
<p>"Pooh!" he said. "No one would guess that
it is here, in my pocket-book."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," she grumbled. "That young man-servant
whom we discharged last week knew all
about it, didn't he, Gabriel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, aunt," said a youth standing beside her.</p>
<p>Nicolas Dugrival, his wife and his nephew Gabriel
were well-known figures at the race-meetings, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102" name="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the regular frequenters saw them almost every day:
Dugrival, a big, fat, red-faced man, who looked as if
he knew how to enjoy life; his wife, also built on
heavy lines, with a coarse, vulgar face, and always
dressed in a plum-coloured silk much the worse for
wear; the nephew, quite young, slender, with
pale features, dark eyes and fair and rather curly
hair.</p>
<p>As a rule, the couple remained seated throughout
the afternoon. It was Gabriel who betted for his
uncle, watching the horses in the paddock, picking
up tips to right and left among the jockeys and
stable-lads, running backward and forward between
the stands and the <i>pari-mutuel</i>.</p>
<p>Luck had favoured them that day, for, three
times, Dugrival's neighbours saw the young man
come back and hand him money.</p>
<p>The fifth race was just finishing. Dugrival lit
a cigar. At that moment, a gentleman in a tight-fitting
brown suit, with a face ending in a peaked
grey beard, came up to him and asked, in a confidential
whisper:</p>
<p>"Does this happen to belong to you, sir?"</p>
<p>And he displayed a gold watch and chain.</p>
<p>Dugrival gave a start:</p>
<p>"Why, yes ... it's mine.... Look,
here are my initials, N. G.: Nicolas Dugrival!"</p>
<p>And he at once, with a movement of terror, clapped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103" name="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his hand to his jacket-pocket. The note-case was
still there.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, greatly relieved, "that's a piece
of luck!... But, all the same, how on earth
was it done?... Do you know the scoundrel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we've got him locked up. Pray come
with me and we'll soon look into the matter."</p>
<p>"Whom have I the honour ...?"</p>
<p>"M. Delangle, detective-inspector. I have sent
to let M. Marquenne, the magistrate, know."</p>
<p>Nicolas Dugrival went out with the inspector;
and the two of them started for the commissary's
office, some distance behind the grand stand. They
were within fifty yards of it, when the inspector
was accosted by a man who said to him, hurriedly:</p>
<p>"The fellow with the watch has blabbed; we
are on the tracks of a whole gang. M. Marquenne
wants you to wait for him at the <i>pari-mutuel</i> and
to keep a look-out near the fourth booth."</p>
<p>There was a crowd outside the betting-booths
and Inspector Delangle muttered:</p>
<p>"It's an absurd arrangement.... Whom
am I to look out for?... That's just like
M. Marquenne!..."</p>
<p>He pushed aside a group of people who were
crowding too close upon him:</p>
<p>"By Jove, one has to use one's elbows here and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104" name="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
keep a tight hold on one's purse. That's the way
you got your watch pinched, M. Dugrival!"</p>
<p>"I can't understand...."</p>
<p>"Oh, if you knew how those gentry go to work!
One never guesses what they're up to next. One
of them treads on your foot, another gives you a
poke in the eye with his stick and the third picks
your pocket before you know where you are.... I've
been had that way myself." He stopped and
then continued, angrily. "But, bother it, what's the
use of hanging about here! What a mob! It's unbearable!...
Ah, there's M. Marquenne
making signs to us!... One moment, please
... and be sure and wait for me here."</p>
<p>He shouldered his way through the crowd.
Nicolas Dugrival followed him for a moment
with his eyes. Once the inspector was out of
sight, he stood a little to one side, to avoid being
hustled.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed. The sixth race was
about to start, when Dugrival saw his wife and
nephew looking for him. He explained to them
that Inspector Delangle was arranging matters
with the magistrate.</p>
<p>"Have you your money still?" asked his wife.</p>
<p>"Why, of course I have!" he replied. "The
inspector and I took good care, I assure you, not
to let the crowd jostle us."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105" name="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>He felt his jacket, gave a stifled cry, thrust
his hand into his pocket and began to stammer
inarticulate syllables, while Mme. Dugrival gasped,
in dismay:</p>
<p>"What is it? What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Stolen!" he moaned. "The pocket-book ... the
fifty notes!..."</p>
<p>"It's not true!" she screamed. "It's not
true!"</p>
<p>"Yes, the inspector ... a common sharper ... he's
the man...."</p>
<p>She uttered absolute yells:</p>
<p>"Thief! Thief! Stop thief!... My husband's
been robbed!... Fifty thousand francs!... We
are ruined!... Thief! Thief ..."</p>
<p>In a moment they were surrounded by policemen
and taken to the commissary's office. Dugrival
went like a lamb, absolutely bewildered. His wife
continued to shriek at the top of her voice, piling
up explanations, railing against the inspector:</p>
<p>"Have him looked for!... Have him found!... A
brown suit.... A pointed beard.... Oh,
the villain, to think what he's robbed us
of!... Fifty thousand francs!... Why ... why,
Dugrival, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>With one bound, she flung herself upon her
husband. Too late! He had pressed the barrel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106" name="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of a revolver against his temple. A shot rang
out. Dugrival fell. He was dead.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>The reader cannot have forgotten the commotion
made by the newspapers in connection with this
case, nor how they jumped at the opportunity
once more to accuse the police of carelessness and
blundering. Was it conceivable that a pick-pocket
could play the part of an inspector like that,
in broad daylight and in a public place, and rob a
respectable man with impunity?</p>
<p>Nicolas Dugrival's widow kept the controversy
alive, thanks to her jeremiads and to the interviews
which she granted on every hand. A reporter
had secured a snapshot of her in front of her husband's
body, holding up her hand and swearing to
revenge his death. Her nephew Gabriel was
standing beside her, with hatred pictured in his
face. He, too, it appeared, in a few words uttered
in a whisper, but in a tone of fierce determination,
had taken an oath to pursue and catch the murderer.</p>
<p>The accounts described the humble apartment
which they occupied at the Batignolles; and, as
they had been robbed of all their means, a sporting-paper
opened a subscription on their behalf.</p>
<p>As for the mysterious Delangle, he remained
undiscovered. Two men were arrested, but had
to be released forthwith. The police took up a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107" name="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
number of clues, which were at once abandoned;
more than one name was mentioned; and, lastly,
they accused Arsène Lupin, an action which provoked
the famous burglar's celebrated cable, dispatched
from New York six days after the incident:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Protest indignantly against calumny invented
by baffled police. Send my condolences to unhappy
victims. Instructing my bankers to remit
them fifty thousand francs.</p>
<p style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 60em;">"Lupin."</p></div>
<p>True enough, on the day after the publication
of the cable, a stranger rang at Mme. Dugrival's
door and handed her an envelope. The envelope
contained fifty thousand-franc notes.</p>
<p>This theatrical stroke was not at all calculated
to allay the universal comment. But an event
soon occurred which provided any amount of
additional excitement. Two days later, the people
living in the same house as Mme. Dugrival and
her nephew were awakened, at four o'clock in the
morning, by horrible cries and shrill calls for help.
They rushed to the flat. The porter succeeded
in opening the door. By the light of a lantern
carried by one of the neighbours, he found Gabriel
stretched at full-length in his bedroom, with his
wrists and ankles bound and a gag forced into his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108" name="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
mouth, while, in the next room, Mme. Dugrival
lay with her life's blood ebbing away through a
great gash in her breast.</p>
<p>She whispered:</p>
<p>"The money.... I've been robbed.... All
the notes gone...."</p>
<p>And she fainted away.</p>
<p>What had happened? Gabriel said—and, as
soon as she was able to speak, Mme. Dugrival completed
her nephew's story—that he was startled
from his sleep by finding himself attacked by two
men, one of whom gagged him, while the other
fastened him down. He was unable to see the men
in the dark, but he heard the noise of the struggle
between them and his aunt. It was a terrible
struggle, Mme. Dugrival declared. The ruffians,
who obviously knew their way about, guided by
some intuition, made straight for the little cupboard
containing the money and, in spite of her resistance
and outcries, laid hands upon the bundle of bank-notes.
As they left, one of them, whom she had
bitten in the arm, stabbed her with a knife, whereupon
the men had both fled.</p>
<p>"Which way?" she was asked.</p>
<p>"Through the door of my bedroom and afterward,
I suppose, through the hall-door."</p>
<p>"Impossible! The porter would have noticed
them."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109" name="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>For the whole mystery lay in this: how had the
ruffians entered the house and how did they manage
to leave it? There was no outlet open to them.
Was it one of the tenants? A careful inquiry
proved the absurdity of such a supposition.</p>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>Chief-inspector Ganimard, who was placed in
special charge of the case, confessed that he had
never known anything more bewildering:</p>
<p>"It's very like Lupin," he said, "and yet it's not
Lupin.... No, there's more in it than meets the
eye, something very doubtful and suspicious....
Besides, if it were Lupin, why should he take back
the fifty thousand francs which he sent? There's
another question that puzzles me: what is the
connection between the second robbery and the first,
the one on the race-course? The whole thing is
incomprehensible and I have a sort of feeling—which
is very rare with me—that it is no use hunting.
For my part, I give it up."</p>
<p>The examining-magistrate threw himself into the
case with heart and soul. The reporters united
their efforts with those of the police. A famous
English sleuth-hound crossed the Channel. A
wealthy American, whose head had been turned
by detective-stories, offered a big reward to whosoever
should supply the first information leading
to the discovery of the truth. Six weeks later,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110" name="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
no one was any the wiser. The public adopted
Ganimard's view; and the examining-magistrate
himself grew tired of struggling in a darkness which
only became denser as time went on.</p>
<p>And life continued as usual with Dugrival's
widow. Nursed by her nephew, she soon recovered
from her wound. In the mornings, Gabriel settled
her in an easy-chair at the dining-room window, did
the rooms and then went out marketing. He cooked
their lunch without even accepting the proffered
assistance of the porter's wife.</p>
<p>Worried by the police investigations and especially
by the requests for interviews, the aunt and nephew
refused to see anybody. Not even the portress,
whose chatter disturbed and wearied Mme. Dugrival,
was admitted. She fell back upon Gabriel, whom
she accosted each time that he passed her room:</p>
<p>"Take care, M. Gabriel, you're both of you being
spied upon. There are men watching you. Why,
only last night, my husband caught a fellow staring
up at your windows."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Gabriel. "It's all right. That's
the police, protecting us."</p>
<p>One afternoon, at about four o'clock, there was
a violent altercation between two costermongers
at the bottom of the street. The porter's wife at
once left her room to listen to the invectives which
the adversaries were hurling at each other's heads.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111" name="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Her back was no sooner turned than a man, young,
of medium height and dressed in a grey suit of irreproachable
cut, slipped into the house and ran up
the staircase.</p>
<p>When he came to the third floor, he rang the bell.
Receiving no answer, he rang again. At the third
summons, the door opened.</p>
<p>"Mme. Dugrival?" he asked, taking off his hat.</p>
<p>"Mme. Dugrival is still an invalid and unable to
see any one," said Gabriel, who stood in the hall.</p>
<p>"It's most important that I should speak to
her."</p>
<p>"I am her nephew and perhaps I could take her
a message...."</p>
<p>"Very well," said the man. "Please tell Mme.
Dugrival that an accident has supplied me with
valuable information concerning the robbery from
which she has suffered and that I should like to go
over the flat and ascertain certain particulars for
myself. I am accustomed to this sort of inquiry;
and my call is sure to be of use to her."</p>
<p>Gabriel examined the visitor for a moment,
reflected and said:</p>
<p>"In that case, I suppose my aunt will consent ... Pray
come in."</p>
<p>He opened the door of the dining-room and stepped
back to allow the other to pass. The stranger walked
to the threshold, but, at the moment when he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112" name="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
crossing it, Gabriel raised his arm and, with a swift
movement, struck him with a dagger over the right
shoulder.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter rang through the room:</p>
<p>"Got him!" cried Mme. Dugrival, darting up
from her chair. "Well done, Gabriel! But, I
say, you haven't killed the scoundrel, have you?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so, aunt. It's a small blade and
I didn't strike him too hard."</p>
<p>The man was staggering, with his hands stretched
in front of him and his face deathly pale.</p>
<p>"You fool!" sneered the widow. "So you've
fallen into the trap ... and a good job too!
We've been looking out for you a long time. Come,
my fine fellow, down with you! You don't care
about it, do you? But you can't help yourself,
you see. That's right: one knee on the ground,
before the missus ... now the other knee....
How well we've been brought up!... Crash,
there we go on the floor! Lord, if my poor Dugrival
could only see him like that!... And now, Gabriel,
to work!"</p>
<p>She went to her bedroom and opened one of the
doors of a hanging wardrobe filled with dresses.
Pulling these aside, she pushed open another door
which formed the back of the wardrobe and led to
a room in the next house:</p>
<p>"Help me carry him, Gabriel. And you'll nurse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113" name="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
him as well as you can, won't you? For the present,
he's worth his weight in gold to us, the artist!..."</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>The hours succeeded one another. Days passed.</p>
<p>One morning, the wounded man regained a moment's
consciousness. He raised his eyelids and
looked around him.</p>
<p>He was lying in a room larger than that in which
he had been stabbed, a room sparsely furnished,
with thick curtains hanging before the windows
from top to bottom. There was light enough, however,
to enable him to see young Gabriel Dugrival
seated on a chair beside him and watching him.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's you, youngster!" he murmured. "I
congratulate you, my lad. You have a sure and
pretty touch with the dagger."</p>
<p>And he fell asleep again.</p>
<p>That day and the following days, he woke up
several times and, each time, he saw the stripling's
pale face, his thin lips and his dark eyes, with the
hard look in them:</p>
<p>"You frighten me," he said. "If you have
sworn to do for me, don't stand on ceremony. But
cheer up, for goodness' sake. The thought of death
has always struck me as the most humorous thing
in the world. Whereas, with you, old chap, it
simply becomes lugubrious. I prefer to go to sleep.
Good-night!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114" name="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>Still, Gabriel, in obedience to Mme. Dugrival's
orders, continued to nurse him with the utmost care
and attention. The patient was almost free from
fever and was beginning to take beef-tea and milk.
He gained a little strength and jested:</p>
<p>"When will the convalescent be allowed his
first drive? Is the bath-chair there? Why, cheer
up, stupid! You look like a weeping-willow contemplating
a crime. Come, just one little smile
for daddy!"</p>
<p>One day, on waking, he had a very unpleasant
feeling of constraint. After a few efforts, he perceived
that, during his sleep, his legs, chest and arms
had been fastened to the bedstead with thin wire
strands that cut into his flesh at the least movements.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said to his keeper, "this time it's the
great performance! The chicken's going to be bled.
Are you operating, Angel Gabriel? If so, see that
your razor's nice and clean, old chap! The antiseptic
treatment, <i>if</i> you please!"</p>
<p>But he was interrupted by the sound of a key
grating in the lock. The door opposite opened and
Mme. Dugrival appeared.</p>
<p>She approached slowly, took a chair and, producing
a revolver from her pocket, cocked it and
laid it on the table by the bedside.</p>
<p>"Brrrrr!" said the prisoner. "We might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115" name="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
at the Ambigu!... Fourth act: the Traitor's
Doom. And the fair sex to do the deed.... The
hand of the Graces.... What an honour!...
Mme. Dugrival, I rely on you not to disfigure me."</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, Lupin."</p>
<p>"Ah, so you know?... By Jove, how clever
we are!"</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, Lupin."</p>
<p>There was a solemn note in her voice that impressed
the captive and compelled him to silence.
He watched his two gaolers in turns. The bloated
features and red complexion of Mme. Dugrival
formed a striking contrast with her nephew's refined
face; but they both wore the same air of implacable
resolve.</p>
<p>The widow leant forward and said:</p>
<p>"Are you prepared to answer my questions?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Then listen to me. How did you know that
Dugrival carried all his money in his pocket?"</p>
<p>"Servants' gossip...."</p>
<p>"A young man-servant whom we had in our employ:
was that it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And did you steal Dugrival's watch in order
to give it back to him and inspire him with confidence?"</p>
<p>"Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116" name="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>She suppressed a movement of fury:</p>
<p>"You fool! You fool!... What! You rob
my man, you drive him to kill himself and, instead
of making tracks to the uttermost ends of the earth
and hiding yourself, you go on playing Lupin in
the heart of Paris!... Did you forget that I
swore, on my dead husband's head, to find his murderer?"</p>
<p>"That's what staggers me," said Lupin. "How
did you come to suspect me?"</p>
<p>"How? Why, you gave yourself away!"</p>
<p>"I did?..."</p>
<p>"Of course.... The fifty thousand francs...."</p>
<p>"Well, what about it? A present...."</p>
<p>"Yes, a present which you gave cabled instructions
to have sent to me, so as to make believe that
you were in America on the day of the races. A
present, indeed! What humbug! The fact is,
you didn't like to think of the poor fellow whom you
had murdered. So you restored the money to the
widow, publicly, of course, because you love playing
to the gallery and ranting and posing, like the
mountebank that you are. That was all very nicely
thought out. Only, my fine fellow, you ought not
to have sent me the selfsame notes that were stolen
from Dugrival! Yes, you silly fool, the selfsame
notes and no others! We knew the numbers,
Dugrival and I did. And you were stupid enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117" name="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to send the bundle to me. Now do you understand
your folly?"</p>
<p>Lupin began to laugh:</p>
<p>"It was a pretty blunder, I confess. I'm not
responsible; I gave different orders. But, all the
same I can't blame any one except myself."</p>
<p>"Ah, so you admit it! You signed your theft
and you signed your ruin at the same time. There
was nothing left to be done but to find you. Find
you? No, better than that. Sensible people don't
find Lupin: they make him come to them! That
was a masterly notion. It belongs to my young
nephew, who loathes you as much as I do, if possible,
and who knows you thoroughly, through reading
all the books that have been written about you.
He knows your prying nature, your need to be
always plotting, your mania for hunting in the dark
and unravelling what others have failed to unravel.
He also knows that sort of sham kindness of yours,
the drivelling sentimentality that makes you shed
crocodile tears over the people you victimize;
And he planned the whole farce! He invented the
story of the two burglars, the second theft of fifty
thousand francs! Oh, I swear to you, before Heaven,
that the stab which I gave myself with my own
hands never hurt me! And I swear to you, before
Heaven, that we spent a glorious time waiting for
you, the boy and I, peeping out at your confederates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118" name="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
who prowled under our windows, taking their bearings!
And there was no mistake about it: you
were bound to come! Seeing that you had restored
the Widow Dugrival's fifty thousand francs,
it was out of the question that you should allow the
Widow Dugrival to be robbed of her fifty thousand
francs! You were bound to come, attracted by the
scent of the mystery. You were bound to come, for
swagger, out of vanity! And you come!"</p>
<p>The widow gave a strident laugh:</p>
<p>"Well played, wasn't it? The Lupin of Lupins,
the master of masters, inaccessible and invisible,
caught in a trap by a woman and a boy!...
Here he is in flesh and bone ... here he is with
hands and feet tied, no more dangerous than a sparrow ... here
is he ... here he is!..."</p>
<p>She shook with joy and began to pace the room,
throwing sidelong glances at the bed, like a wild
beast that does not for a moment take its eyes from
its victim. And never had Lupin beheld greater
hatred and savagery in any human being.</p>
<p>"Enough of this prattle," she said.</p>
<p>Suddenly restraining herself, she stalked back to
him and, in a quite different tone, in a hollow voice,
laying stress on every syllable:</p>
<p>"Thanks to the papers in your pocket, Lupin,
I have made good use of the last twelve days. I
know all your affairs, all your schemes, all your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119" name="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
assumed names, all the organization of your band,
all the lodgings which you possess in Paris and elsewhere.
I have even visited one of them, the most
secret, the one where you hide your papers, your
ledgers and the whole story of your financial operations.
The result of my investigations is very
satisfactory. Here are four cheques, taken from
four cheque-books and corresponding with four
accounts which you keep at four different banks
under four different names. I have filled in each
of them for ten thousand francs. A larger figure
would have been too risky. And, now, sign."</p>
<p>"By Jove!" said Lupin, sarcastically. "This
is blackmail, my worthy Mme. Dugrival."</p>
<p>"That takes your breath away, what?"</p>
<p>"It takes my breath away, as you say."</p>
<p>"And you find an adversary who is a match for
you?"</p>
<p>"The adversary is far beyond me. So the trap—let
us call it infernal—the infernal trap into
which I have fallen was laid not merely by a widow
thirsting for revenge, but also by a first-rate business
woman anxious to increase her capital?"</p>
<p>"Just so."</p>
<p>"My congratulations. And, while I think of it,
used M. Dugrival perhaps to ...?"</p>
<p>"You have hit it, Lupin. After all, why conceal
the fact? It will relieve your conscience. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120" name="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Lupin, Dugrival used to work on the same lines as
yourself. Oh, not on the same scale!... We were
modest people: a louis here, a louis there ... a
purse or two which we trained Gabriel to pick up
at the races.... And, in this way, we had made our
little pile ... just enough to buy a small place in
the country."</p>
<p>"I prefer it that way," said Lupin.</p>
<p>"That's all right! I'm only telling you, so that
you may know that I am not a beginner and that
you have nothing to hope for. A rescue? No.
The room in which we now are communicates with
my bedroom. It has a private outlet of which
nobody knows. It was Dugrival's special apartment.
He used to see his friends here. He kept
his implements and tools here, his disguises ...
his telephone even, as you perceive. So there's
no hope, you see. Your accomplices have given
up looking for you here. I have sent them off on
another track. Your goose is cooked. Do you
begin to realize the position?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then sign the cheques."</p>
<p>"And, when I have signed them, shall I be free?"</p>
<p>"I must cash them first."</p>
<p>"And after that?"</p>
<p>"After that, on my soul, as I hope to be saved,
you will be free."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121" name="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't trust you."</p>
<p>"Have you any choice?"</p>
<p>"That's true. Hand me the cheques."</p>
<p>She unfastened Lupin's right hand, gave him a
pen and said:</p>
<p>"Don't forget that the four cheques require four
different signatures and that the handwriting has
to be altered in each case."</p>
<p>"Never fear."</p>
<p>He signed the cheques.</p>
<p>"Gabriel," said the widow, "it is ten o'clock.
If I am not back by twelve, it will mean that this
scoundrel has played me one of his tricks. At
twelve o'clock, blow out his brains. I am leaving
you the revolver with which your uncle shot himself.
There are five bullets left out of the six. That will
be ample."</p>
<p>She left the room, humming a tune as she went.</p>
<p>Lupin mumbled:</p>
<p>"I wouldn't give twopence for my life."</p>
<p>He shut his eyes for an instant and then, suddenly,
said to Gabriel:</p>
<p>"How much?"</p>
<p>And, when the other did not appear to understand,
he grew irritated:</p>
<p>"I mean what I say. How much? Answer
me, can't you? We drive the same trade, you and
I. I steal, thou stealest, we steal. So we ought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122" name="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to come to terms: that's what we are here for.
Well? Is it a bargain? Shall we clear out together.
I will give you a post in my gang, an easy,
well-paid post. How much do you want for yourself?
Ten thousand? Twenty thousand? Fix your
own price; don't be shy. There's plenty to be had
for the asking."</p>
<p>An angry shiver passed through his frame as he
saw the impassive face of his keeper:</p>
<p>"Oh, the beggar won't even answer! Why, you
can't have been so fond of old Dugrival as all that!
Listen to me: if you consent to release me...."</p>
<p>But he interrupted himself. The young man's
eyes wore the cruel expression which he knew so
well. What was the use of trying to move him?</p>
<p>"Hang it all!" he snarled. "I'm not going to
croak here, like a dog! Oh, if I could only...."</p>
<p>Stiffening all his muscles, he tried to burst his
bonds, making a violent effort that drew a cry of
pain from him; and he fell back upon his bed, exhausted.</p>
<p>"Well, well," he muttered, after a moment, "it's
as the widow said: my goose is cooked. Nothing
to be done. <i>De profundis</i>, Lupin."</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour passed, half an hour....</p>
<p>Gabriel, moving closer to Lupin, saw that his
eyes were shut and that his breath came evenly,
like that of a man sleeping. But Lupin said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123" name="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't imagine that I'm asleep, youngster. No,
people don't sleep at a moment like this. Only
I am consoling myself. Needs must, eh?...
And then I am thinking of what is to come after....
Exactly. I have a little theory of my own about
that. You wouldn't think it, to look at me, but
I believe in metempsychosis, in the transmigration
of souls. It would take too long to explain, however....
I say, boy ... suppose we shook hands
before we part? You won't? Then good-bye.
Good health and a long life to you, Gabriel!..."</p>
<p>He closed his eyelids and did not stir again before
Mme. Dugrival's return.</p>
<p>The widow entered with a lively step, at a few
minutes before twelve. She seemed greatly excited:</p>
<p>"I have the money," she said to her nephew.
"Run away. I'll join you in the motor down below."</p>
<p>"But...."</p>
<p>"I don't want your help to finish him off. I
can do that alone. Still, if you feel like seeing
the sort of a face a rogue can pull.... Pass me
the weapon."</p>
<p>Gabriel handed her the revolver and the widow
continued:</p>
<p>"Have you burnt our papers?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then to work. And, as soon as he's done for,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124" name="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be off. The shots may bring the neighbours. They
must find both the flats empty."</p>
<p>She went up to the bed:</p>
<p>"Are you ready, Lupin?"</p>
<p>"Ready's not the word: I'm burning with impatience."</p>
<p>"Have you any request to make of me?"</p>
<p>"None."</p>
<p>"Then...."</p>
<p>"One word, though."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"If I meet Dugrival in the next world, what
message am I to give him from you?"</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and put the barrel
of the revolver to Lupin's temple.</p>
<p>"That's it," he said, "and be sure your hand
doesn't shake, my dear lady. It won't hurt you,
I swear. Are you ready? At the word of command,
eh? One ... two ... three...."</p>
<p>The widow pulled the trigger. A shot rang out.</p>
<p>"Is this death?" said Lupin. "That's funny!
I should have thought it was something much more
different from life!"</p>
<p>There was a second shot. Gabriel snatched the
weapon from his aunt's hands and examined it:</p>
<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, "the bullets have been
removed!... There are only the percussion-caps
left!..."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125" name="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>His aunt and he stood motionless, for a moment,
and confused:</p>
<p>"Impossible!" she blurted out. "Who could
have done it?... An inspector?... The examining-magistrate?..."</p>
<p>She stopped and, in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Hark.... I hear a noise...."</p>
<p>They listened and the widow went into the hall.
She returned, furious, exasperated by her failure
and by the scare which she had received:</p>
<p>"There's nobody there.... It must have been
the neighbours going out.... We have plenty
of time.... Ah, Lupin, you were beginning to
make merry!... The knife, Gabriel."</p>
<p>"It's in my room."</p>
<p>"Go and fetch it."</p>
<p>Gabriel hurried away. The widow stamped with
rage:</p>
<p>"I've sworn to do it!... You've got to suffer,
my fine fellow!... I swore to Dugrival that I
would do it and I have repeated my oath every morning
and evening since.... I have taken it on
my knees, yes, on my knees, before Heaven that
listens to me! It's my duty and my right to
revenge my dead husband!... By the way,
Lupin, you don't look quite as merry as you did!...
Lord, one would almost think you were
afraid!... He's afraid! He's afraid! I can see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126" name="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
it in his eyes!... Come along, Gabriel, my
boy!... Look at his eyes!... Look at his
lips!... He's trembling!... Give me the knife,
so that I may dig it into his heart while he's shivering....
Oh, you coward!... Quick, quick,
Gabriel, the knife!..."</p>
<p>"I can't find it anywhere," said the young man,
running back in dismay. "It has gone from my
room! I can't make it out!"</p>
<p>"Never mind!" cried the Widow Dugrival, half
demented. "All the better! I will do the business
myself."</p>
<p>She seized Lupin by the throat, clutched him
with her ten fingers, digging her nails into his flesh,
and began to squeeze with all her might. Lupin
uttered a hoarse rattle and gave himself up for
lost.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a crash at the window. One
of the panes was smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>"What's that? What is it?" stammered the
widow, drawing herself erect, in alarm.</p>
<p>Gabriel, who had turned even paler than usual,
murmured:</p>
<p>"I don't know.... I can't think...."</p>
<p>"Who can have done it?" said the widow.</p>
<p>She dared not move, waiting for what would
come next. And one thing above all terrified her,
the fact that there was no missile on the floor around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127" name="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
them, although the pane of glass, as was clearly
visible, had given way before the crash of a heavy
and fairly large object, a stone, probably.</p>
<p>After a while, she looked under the bed, under
the chest of drawers:</p>
<p>"Nothing," she said.</p>
<p>"No," said her nephew, who was also looking.
And, resuming her seat, she said:</p>
<p>"I feel frightened ... my arms fail me ... you
finish him off...."</p>
<p>Gabriel confessed:</p>
<p>"I'm frightened also."</p>
<p>"Still ... still," she stammered, "it's got to
be done.... I swore it...."</p>
<p>Making one last effort, she returned to Lupin
and gasped his neck with her stiff fingers. But
Lupin, who was watching her pallid face, received
a very clear sensation that she would not have
the courage to kill him. To her he was becoming
something sacred, invulnerable. A mysterious power
was protecting him against every attack, a power
which had already saved him three times by inexplicable
means and which would find other means
to protect him against the wiles of death.</p>
<p>She said to him, in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"How you must be laughing at me!"</p>
<p>"Not at all, upon my word. I should feel frightened
myself, in your place."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128" name="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>"Nonsense, you scum of the earth! You
imagine that you will be rescued ... that your
friends are waiting outside? It's out of the question,
my fine fellow."</p>
<p>"I know. It's not they defending me ... nobody's
defending me...."</p>
<p>"Well, then?..."</p>
<p>"Well, all the same, there's something strange
at the bottom of it, something fantastic and
miraculous that makes your flesh creep, my fine
lady."</p>
<p>"You villain!... You'll be laughing on the
other side of your mouth before long."</p>
<p>"I doubt it."</p>
<p>"You wait and see."</p>
<p>She reflected once more and said to her nephew:</p>
<p>"What would you do?"</p>
<p>"Fasten his arm again and let's be off," he
replied.</p>
<p>A hideous suggestion! It meant condemning
Lupin to the most horrible of all deaths, death by
starvation.</p>
<p>"No," said the widow. "He might still find a
means of escape. I know something better than
that."</p>
<p>She took down the receiver of the telephone,
waited and asked:</p>
<p>"Number 82248, please."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129" name="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>And, after a second or two:</p>
<p>"Hullo!... Is that the Criminal Investigation
Department?... Is Chief-inspector Ganimard
there?... In twenty minutes, you say?... I'm
sorry!... However!... When he comes, give
him this message from Mme. Dugrival.... Yes,
Mme. Nicolas Dugrival.... Ask him to come to
my flat. Tell him to open the looking-glass door
of my wardrobe; and, when he has done so, he will
see that the wardrobe hides an outlet which makes
my bedroom communicate with two other rooms.
In one of these, he will find a man bound hand and
foot. It is the thief, Dugrival's murderer....
You don't believe me?... Tell M. Ganimard;
he'll believe me right enough.... Oh, I was
almost forgetting to give you the man's name:
Arsène Lupin!"</p>
<p>And, without another word, she replaced the
receiver.</p>
<p>"There, Lupin, that's done. After all, I would
just as soon have my revenge this way. How I
shall hold my sides when I read the reports of the
Lupin trial!... Are you coming, Gabriel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, aunt."</p>
<p>"Good-bye, Lupin. You and I sha'n't see each
other again, I expect, for we are going abroad. But
I promise to send you some sweets while you're in
prison."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130" name="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>"Chocolates, mother! We'll eat them together!"</p>
<p>"Good-bye."</p>
<p>"<i>Au revoir.</i>"</p>
<p>The widow went out with her nephew, leaving
Lupin fastened down to the bed.</p>
<p>He at once moved his free arm and tried to release
himself; but he realized, at the first attempt,
that he would never have the strength to break
the wire strands that bound him. Exhausted
with fever and pain, what could he do in the twenty
minutes or so that were left to him before Ganimard's
arrival?</p>
<p>Nor did he count upon his friends. True, he
had been thrice saved from death; but this was
evidently due to an astounding series of accidents
and not to any interference on the part of his
allies. Otherwise they would not have contented
themselves with these extraordinary manifestations,
but would have rescued him for good and
all.</p>
<p>No, he must abandon all hope. Ganimard was
coming. Ganimard would find him there. It was
inevitable. There was no getting away from the
fact.</p>
<p>And the prospect of what was coming irritated
him singularly. He already heard his old enemy's
gibes ringing in his ears. He foresaw the roars
of laughter with which the incredible news would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131" name="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
be greeted on the morrow. To be arrested in action,
so to speak, on the battlefield, by an imposing
detachment of adversaries, was one thing: but
to be arrested, or rather picked up, scraped up,
gathered up, in such condition, was really too
silly. And Lupin, who had so often scoffed at
others, felt all the ridicule that was falling to his
share in this ending of the Dugrival business, all
the bathos of allowing himself to be caught in the
widow's infernal trap and finally of being "served
up" to the police like a dish of game, roasted to
a turn and nicely seasoned.</p>
<p>"Blow the widow!" he growled. "I had rather
she had cut my throat and done with it."</p>
<p>He pricked up his ears. Some one was moving
in the next room. Ganimard! No. Great as
his eagerness would be, he could not be there yet.
Besides, Ganimard would not have acted like that,
would not have opened the door as gently as that
other person was doing. What other person?
Lupin remembered the three miraculous interventions
to which he owed his life. Was it possible
that there was really somebody who had protected
him against the widow, and that that somebody
was now attempting to rescue him? But, if so,
who?</p>
<p>Unseen by Lupin, the stranger stooped behind the
bed. Lupin heard the sound of the pliers attacking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132" name="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the wire strands and releasing him little by little.
First his chest was freed, then his arms, then his
legs.</p>
<p>And a voice said to him:</p>
<p>"You must get up and dress."</p>
<p>Feeling very weak, he half-raised himself in bed
at the moment when the stranger rose from her
stooping posture.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he whispered. "Who are
you?"</p>
<p>And a great surprise over came him.</p>
<p>By his side stood a woman, a woman dressed in
black, with a lace shawl over her head, covering
part of her face. And the woman, as far as he
could judge, was young and of a graceful and slender
stature.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"You must come now," said the woman. "There's
no time to lose."</p>
<p>"Can I?" asked Lupin, making a desperate effort.
"I doubt if I have the strength."</p>
<p>"Drink this."</p>
<p>She poured some milk into a cup; and, as she
handed it to him, her lace opened, leaving the face
uncovered.</p>
<p>"You!" he stammered. "It's you!... It's you
who ... it was you who were...."</p>
<p>He stared in amazement at this woman whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133" name="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
features presented so striking a resemblance to
Gabriel's, whose delicate, regular face had the same
pallor, whose mouth wore the same hard and forbidding
expression. No sister could have borne
so great a likeness to her brother. There was not
a doubt possible: it was the identical person.
And, without believing for a moment that Gabriel
had concealed himself in a woman's clothes, Lupin,
on the contrary, received the distinct impression
that it was a woman standing beside him and that
the stripling who had pursued him with his hatred
and struck him with the dagger was in very deed a
woman. In order to follow their trade with greater
ease, the Dugrival pair had accustomed her to disguise
herself as a boy.</p>
<p>"You ... you ...!" he repeated. "Who would
have suspected ...?"</p>
<p>She emptied the contents of a phial into the
cup:</p>
<p>"Drink this cordial," she said.</p>
<p>He hesitated, thinking of poison.</p>
<p>She added:</p>
<p>"It was I who saved you."</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," he said. "It was you
who removed the bullets from the revolver?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And you who hid the knife?"</p>
<p>"Here it is, in my pocket."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134" name="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>"And you who smashed the window-pane while
your aunt was throttling me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was I, with the paper-weight on the
table: I threw it into the street."</p>
<p>"But why? Why?" he asked, in utter amazement.</p>
<p>"Drink the cordial."</p>
<p>"Didn't you want me to die? But then why
did you stab me to begin with?"</p>
<p>"Drink the cordial."</p>
<p>He emptied the cup at a draught, without quite
knowing the reason of his sudden confidence.</p>
<p>"Dress yourself ... quickly," she commanded,
retiring to the window.</p>
<p>He obeyed and she came back to him, for he had
dropped into a chair, exhausted.</p>
<p>"We must go now, we must, we have only just
time.... Collect your strength."</p>
<p>She bent forward a little, so that he might lean
on her shoulder, and turned toward the door and
the staircase.</p>
<p>And Lupin walked as one walks in a dream, one
of those queer dreams in which the most inconsequent
things occur, a dream that was the happy
sequel of the terrible nightmare in which he had
lived for the past fortnight.</p>
<p>A thought struck him, however. He began to
laugh:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135" name="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p>"Poor Ganimard! Upon my word, the fellow
has no luck, I would give twopence to see him
coming to arrest me."</p>
<p>After descending the staircase with the aid of his
companion, who supported him with incredible
vigour, he found himself in the street, opposite a
motor-car into which she helped him to mount.</p>
<p>"Right away," she said to the driver.</p>
<p>Lupin, dazed by the open air and the speed at
which they were travelling, hardly took stock of the
drive and of the incidents on the road. He recovered
all his consciousness when he found himself at home
in one of the flats which he occupied, looked after
by his servant, to whom the girl gave a few rapid
instructions.</p>
<p>"You can go," he said to the man.</p>
<p>But, when the girl turned to go as well, he held
her back by a fold of her dress.</p>
<p>"No ... no ... you must first explain....
Why did you save me? Did you return unknown
to your aunt? But why did you save me? Was
it from pity?"</p>
<p>She did not answer. With her figure drawn up
and her head flung back a little, she retained her
hard and impenetrable air. Nevertheless, he thought
he noticed that the lines of her mouth showed not
so much cruelty as bitterness. Her eyes, her beautiful
dark eyes, revealed melancholy. And Lupin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136" name="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
without as yet understanding, received a vague
intuition of what was passing within her. He
seized her hand. She pushed him away, with a
start of revolt in which he felt hatred, almost repulsion.
And, when he insisted, she cried:</p>
<p>"Let me be, will you?... Let me be!...
Can't you see that I detest you?"</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a moment, Lupin
disconcerted, she quivering and full of uneasiness,
her pale face all flushed with unwonted colour.</p>
<p>He said to her, gently:</p>
<p>"If you detested me, you should have let me
die.... It was simple enough.... Why
didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Why?... Why?... How do I know?..."</p>
<p>Her face contracted. With a sudden movement,
she hid it in her two hands; and he saw tears trickle
between her fingers.</p>
<p>Greatly touched, he thought of addressing her
in fond words, such as one would use to a little girl
whom one wished to console, and of giving her good
advice and saving her, in his turn, and snatching her
from the bad life which she was leading, perhaps
against her better nature.</p>
<p>But such words would have sounded ridiculous,
coming from his lips, and he did not know what to
say, now that he understood the whole story and
was able to picture the young woman sitting beside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137" name="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
his sick-bed, nursing the man whom she had wounded,
admiring his pluck and gaiety, becoming attached
to him, falling in love with him and thrice over,
probably in spite of herself, under a sort of instinctive
impulse, amid fits of spite and rage, saving him
from death.</p>
<p>And all this was so strange, so unforeseen; Lupin
was so much unmanned by his astonishment, that,
this time, he did not try to retain her when she
made for the door, backward, without taking her
eyes from him.</p>
<p>She lowered her head, smiled for an instant and
disappeared.</p>
<p>He rang the bell, quickly:</p>
<p>"Follow that woman," he said to his man. "Or
no, stay where you are.... After all, it is better
so...."</p>
<p>He sat brooding for a while, possessed by the
girl's image. Then he revolved in his mind all that
curious, stirring and tragic adventure, in which he
had been so very near succumbing; and, taking a
hand-glass from the table, he gazed for a long time
and with a certain self-complacency at his features,
which illness and pain had not succeeded in impairing
to any great extent:</p>
<p>"Good looks count for something, after all!" he
muttered.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a id="V" name="V"></a>V</h2>
<h3 class="chapter2">THE RED SILK SCARF</h3>
<p>On leaving his house one morning, at his usual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138" name="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
early hour for going to the Law Courts, Chief-inspector
Ganimard noticed the curious behaviour
of an individual who was walking along the Rue
Pergolèse in front of him. Shabbily dressed and
wearing a straw hat, though the day was the first
of December, the man stooped at every thirty or
forty yards to fasten his boot-lace, or pick up his
stick, or for some other reason. And, each time,
he took a little piece of orange-peel from his pocket
and laid it stealthily on the kerb of the pavement.
It was probably a mere display of eccentricity, a
childish amusement to which no one else would
have paid attention; but Ganimard was one of those
shrewd observers who are indifferent to nothing
that strikes their eyes and who are never satisfied
until they know the secret cause of things. He
therefore began to follow the man.</p>
<p>Now, at the moment when the fellow was turning
to the right, into the Avenue de la Grande-Armée,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139" name="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the inspector caught him exchanging signals with
a boy of twelve or thirteen, who was walking along
the houses on the left-hand side. Twenty yards
farther, the man stooped and turned up the bottom
of his trousers legs. A bit of orange-peel marked
the place. At the same moment, the boy stopped
and, with a piece of chalk, drew a white cross,
surrounded by a circle, on the wall of the house
next to him.</p>
<p>The two continued on their way. A minute
later, a fresh halt. The strange individual picked
up a pin and dropped a piece of orange-peel; and
the boy at once made a second cross on the wall
and again drew a white circle round it.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" thought the chief-inspector, with
a grunt of satisfaction. "This is rather promising....
What on earth can those two merchants be
plotting?"</p>
<p>The two "merchants" went down the Avenue
Friedland and the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré,
but nothing occurred that was worthy of special
mention. The double performance was repeated
at almost regular intervals and, so to speak, mechanically.
Nevertheless, it was obvious, on the
one hand, that the man with the orange-peel did
not do his part of the business until after he had
picked out with a glance the house that was to be
marked and, on the other hand, that the boy did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140" name="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
not mark that particular house until after he had
observed his companion's signal. It was certain,
therefore, that there was an agreement between
the two; and the proceedings presented no small
interest in the chief-inspector's eyes.</p>
<p>At the Place Beauveau the man hesitated. Then,
apparently making up his mind, he twice turned
up and twice turned down the bottom of his trousers
legs. Hereupon, the boy sat down on the kerb,
opposite the sentry who was mounting guard outside
the Ministry of the Interior, and marked the flagstone
with two little crosses contained within two
circles. The same ceremony was gone through
a little further on, when they reached the Elysée.
Only, on the pavement where the President's sentry
was marching up and down, there were three signs
instead of two.</p>
<p>"Hang it all!" muttered Ganimard, pale with
excitement and thinking, in spite of himself, of
his inveterate enemy, Lupin, whose name came to
his mind whenever a mysterious circumstance
presented itself. "Hang it all, what does it
mean?"</p>
<p>He was nearly collaring and questioning the
two "merchants." But he was too clever to
commit so gross a blunder. The man with the
orange-peel had now lit a cigarette; and the boy,
also placing a cigarette-end between his lips, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141" name="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
gone up to him, apparently with the object of asking
for a light.</p>
<p>They exchanged a few words. Quick as thought,
the boy handed his companion an object which
looked—at least, so the inspector believed—like
a revolver. They both bent over this object; and
the man, standing with his face to the wall, put
his hand six times in his pocket and made a movement
as though he were loading a weapon.</p>
<p>As soon as this was done, they walked briskly
to the Rue de Surène; and the inspector, who followed
them as closely as he was able to do without
attracting their attention, saw them enter the
gateway of an old house of which all the shutters
were closed, with the exception of those on the
third or top floor.</p>
<p>He hurried in after them. At the end of the
carriage-entrance he saw a large courtyard, with
a house-painter's sign at the back and a staircase
on the left.</p>
<p>He went up the stairs and, as soon as he reached
the first floor, ran still faster, because he heard,
right up at the top, a din as of a free-fight.</p>
<p>When he came to the last landing he found the
door open. He entered, listened for a second,
caught the sound of a struggle, rushed to the room
from which the sound appeared to proceed and
remained standing on the threshold, very much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142" name="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
out of breath and greatly surprised to see the man
of the orange-peel and the boy banging the floor
with chairs.</p>
<p>At that moment a third person walked out of
an adjoining room. It was a young man of twenty-eight
or thirty, wearing a pair of short whiskers in
addition to his moustache, spectacles, and a smoking-jacket
with an astrakhan collar and looking like a
foreigner, a Russian.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Ganimard," he said. And
turning to the two companions, "Thank you, my
friends, and all my congratulations on the successful
result. Here's the reward I promised you."</p>
<p>He gave them a hundred-franc note, pushed
them outside and shut both doors.</p>
<p>"I am sorry, old chap," he said to Ganimard.
"I wanted to talk to you ... wanted to talk to
you badly."</p>
<p>He offered him his hand and, seeing that the
inspector remained flabbergasted and that his face
was still distorted with anger, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Why, you don't seem to understand!...
And yet it's clear enough.... I wanted to see
you particularly.... So what could I do?"
And, pretending to reply to an objection, "No, no,
old chap," he continued. "You're quite wrong. If
I had written or telephoned, you would not have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143" name="Page_143">[143]</a></span>come ... or else you would have come with
a regiment. Now I wanted to see you all alone;
and I thought the best thing was to send those
two decent fellows to meet you, with orders to
scatter bits of orange-peel and draw crosses and
circles, in short, to mark out your road to this
place.... Why, you look quite bewildered!
What is it? Perhaps you don't recognize me?
Lupin.... Arsène Lupin.... Ransack your
memory.... Doesn't the name remind you
of anything?"</p>
<p>"You dirty scoundrel!" Ganimard snarled between
his teeth.</p>
<p>Lupin seemed greatly distressed and, in an
affectionate voice:</p>
<p>"Are you vexed? Yes, I can see it in your eyes....
The Dugrival business, I suppose? I ought
to have waited for you to come and take me in
charge?... There now, the thought never
occurred to me! I promise you, next time...."</p>
<p>"You scum of the earth!" growled Ganimard.</p>
<p>"And I thinking I was giving you a treat! Upon
my word, I did. I said to myself, 'That dear
old Ganimard! We haven't met for an age. He'll
simply rush at me when he sees me!'"</p>
<p>Ganimard, who had not yet stirred a limb,
seemed to be waking from his stupor. He looked
around him, looked at Lupin, visibly asked himself
whether he would not do well to rush at him in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144" name="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reality and then, controlling himself, took hold of
a chair and settled himself in it, as though he had
suddenly made up his mind to listen to his
enemy:</p>
<p>"Speak," he said. "And don't waste my time
with any nonsense. I'm in a hurry."</p>
<p>"That's it," said Lupin, "let's talk. You
can't imagine a quieter place than this. It's an
old manor-house, which once stood in the open
country, and it belongs to the Duc de Rochelaure.
The duke, who has never lived in it, lets this
floor to me and the outhouses to a painter and
decorator. I always keep up a few establishments
of this kind: it's a sound, practical plan. Here,
in spite of my looking like a Russian nobleman,
I am M. Daubreuil, an ex-cabinet-minister....
You understand, I had to select a rather
overstocked profession, so as not to attract
attention...."</p>
<p>"Do you think I care a hang about all this?"
said Ganimard, interrupting him.</p>
<p>"Quite right, I'm wasting words and you're in a
hurry. Forgive me. I sha'n't be long now....
Five minutes, that's all.... I'll start at once....
Have a cigar? No? Very well, no more will I."</p>
<p>He sat down also, drummed his fingers on the
table, while thinking, and began in this fashion:</p>
<p>"On the 17th of October, 1599, on a warm and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145" name="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sunny autumn day ... Do you follow me?...
But, now that I come to think of it, is it really
necessary to go back to the reign of Henry IV, and
tell you all about the building of the Pont-Neuf?
No, I don't suppose you are very well up in French
history; and I should only end by muddling
you. Suffice it, then, for you to know that, last
night, at one o'clock in the morning, a boatman
passing under the last arch of the Pont-Neuf aforesaid,
along the left bank of the river, heard something
drop into the front part of his barge. The
thing had been flung from the bridge and its evident
destination was the bottom of the Seine. The
bargee's dog rushed forward, barking, and, when the
man reached the end of his craft, he saw the animal
worrying a piece of newspaper that had served to
wrap up a number of objects. He took from the
dog such of the contents as had not fallen into the
water, went to his cabin and examined them carefully.
The result struck him as interesting; and,
as the man is connected with one of my friends, he
sent to let me know. This morning I was waked
up and placed in possession of the facts and of the
objects which the man had collected. Here they
are."</p>
<p>He pointed to them, spread out on a table. There
were, first of all, the torn pieces of a newspaper.
Next came a large cut-glass inkstand, with a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146" name="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
piece of string fastened to the lid. There was a bit
of broken glass and a sort of flexible cardboard,
reduced to shreds. Lastly, there was a piece of
bright scarlet silk, ending in a tassel of the same
material and colour.</p>
<p>"You see our exhibits, friend of my youth,"
said Lupin. "No doubt, the problem would be
more easily solved if we had the other objects which
went overboard owing to the stupidity of the dog.
But it seems to me, all the same, that we ought
to be able to manage, with a little reflection and
intelligence. And those are just your great qualities.
How does the business strike you?"</p>
<p>Ganimard did not move a muscle. He was
willing to stand Lupin's chaff, but his dignity
commanded him not to speak a single word in
answer nor even to give a nod or shake of the head
that might have been taken to express approval or
or criticism.</p>
<p>"I see that we are entirely of one mind," continued
Lupin, without appearing to remark the
chief-inspector's silence. "And I can sum up the
matter briefly, as told us by these exhibits. Yesterday
evening, between nine and twelve o'clock, a
showily dressed young woman was wounded with
a knife and then caught round the throat and choked
to death by a well-dressed gentleman, wearing a
single eyeglass and interested in racing, with whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147" name="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the aforesaid showily dressed young lady had been
eating three meringues and a coffee éclair."</p>
<p>Lupin lit a cigarette and, taking Ganimard by the
sleeve:</p>
<p>"Aha, that's up against you, chief-inspector!
You thought that, in the domain of police deductions,
such feats as those were prohibited to outsiders!
Wrong, sir! Lupin juggles with inferences
and deductions for all the world like a detective
in a novel. My proofs are dazzling and absolutely
simple."</p>
<p>And, pointing to the objects one by one, as he
demonstrated his statement, he resumed:</p>
<p>"I said, after nine o'clock yesterday evening.
This scrap of newspaper bears yesterday's date,
with the words, 'Evening edition.' Also, you will
see here, pasted to the paper, a bit of one of those
yellow wrappers in which the subscribers' copies
are sent out. These copies are always delivered
by the nine o'clock post. Therefore, it was after
nine o'clock. I said, a well-dressed man. Please
observe that this tiny piece of glass has the round
hole of a single eyeglass at one of the edges and that
the single eyeglass is an essentially aristocratic
article of wear. This well-dressed man walked
into a pastry-cook's shop. Here is the very thin
cardboard, shaped like a box, and still showing
a little of the cream of the meringues and éclairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148" name="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
which were packed in it in the usual way. Having
got his parcel, the gentleman with the eyeglass
joined a young person whose eccentricity in the
matter of dress is pretty clearly indicated by this
bright-red silk scarf. Having joined her, for some
reason as yet unknown he first stabbed her with a
knife and then strangled her with the help of this
same scarf. Take your magnifying glass, chief-inspector,
and you will see, on the silk, stains of a
darker red which are, here, the marks of a knife
wiped on the scarf and, there, the marks of a hand,
covered with blood, clutching the material. Having
committed the murder, his next business is to
leave no trace behind him. So he takes from his
pocket, first, the newspaper to which he subscribes—a
racing-paper, as you will see by glancing at
the contents of this scrap; and you will have no
difficulty in discovering the title—and, secondly,
a cord, which, on inspection, turns out to be a
length of whip-cord. These two details prove—do
they not?—that our man is interested in racing
and that he himself rides. Next, he picks up the
fragments of his eyeglass, the cord of which has
been broken in the struggle. He takes a pair of
scissors—observe the hacking of the scissors—and
cuts off the stained part of the scarf, leaving the
other end, no doubt, in his victim's clenched hands.
He makes a ball of the confectioner's cardboard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149" name="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
box. He also puts in certain things that would have
betrayed him, such as the knife, which must have
slipped into the Seine. He wraps everything in
the newspaper, ties it with the cord and fastens this
cut-glass inkstand to it, as a make-weight. Then
he makes himself scarce. A little later, the parcel
falls into the waterman's barge. And there you
are. Oof, it's hot work!... What do you say to
the story?"</p>
<p>He looked at Ganimard to see what impression
his speech had produced on the inspector. Ganimard
did not depart from his attitude of silence.</p>
<p>Lupin began to laugh:</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, you're annoyed and surprised.
But you're suspicious as well: 'Why
should that confounded Lupin hand the business
over to me,' say you, 'instead of keeping it for himself,
hunting down the murderer and rifling his
pockets, if there was a robbery?' The question
is quite logical, of course. But—there is a 'but'—I
have no time, you see. I am full up with work at
the present moment: a burglary in London, another
at Lausanne, an exchange of children at Marseilles,
to say nothing of having to save a young girl who
is at this moment shadowed by death. That's
always the way: it never rains but it pours. So
I said to myself, 'Suppose I handed the business
over to my dear old Ganimard? Now that it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150" name="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
half-solved for him, he is quite capable of succeeding.
And what a service I shall be doing him!
How magnificently he will be able to distinguish
himself!' No sooner said than done. At eight
o'clock in the morning, I sent the joker with the
orange-peel to meet you. You swallowed the bait;
and you were here by nine, all on edge and eager
for the fray."</p>
<p>Lupin rose from his chair. He went over to
the inspector and, with his eyes in Ganimard's,
said:</p>
<p>"That's all. You now know the whole story.
Presently, you will know the victim: some ballet-dancer,
probably, some singer at a music-hall.
On the other hand, the chances are that the criminal
lives near the Pont-Neuf, most likely on the left
bank. Lastly, here are all the exhibits. I make
you a present of them. Set to work. I shall only
keep this end of the scarf. If ever you want to
piece the scarf together, bring me the other end,
the one which the police will find round the
victim's neck. Bring it me in four weeks from now
to the day, that is to say, on the 29th of December,
at ten o'clock in the morning. You can be
sure of finding me here. And don't be afraid:
this is all perfectly serious, friend of my youth;
I swear it is. No humbug, honour bright. You
can go straight ahead. Oh, by the way, when you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151" name="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
arrest the fellow with the eyeglass, be a bit careful:
he is left-handed! Good-bye, old dear, and good
luck to you!"</p>
<p>Lupin spun round on his heel, went to the door,
opened it and disappeared before Ganimard had
even thought of taking a decision. The inspector
rushed after him, but at once found that the handle
of the door, by some trick of mechanism which
he did not know, refused to turn. It took him ten
minutes to unscrew the lock and ten minutes more
to unscrew the lock of the hall-door. By the time
that he had scrambled down the three flights of
stairs, Ganimard had given up all hope of catching
Arsène Lupin.</p>
<p>Besides, he was not thinking of it. Lupin inspired
him with a queer, complex feeling, made
up of fear, hatred, involuntary admiration and also
the vague instinct that he, Ganimard, in spite of
all his efforts, in spite of the persistency of his
endeavours, would never get the better of this
particular adversary. He pursued him from a sense
of duty and pride, but with the continual dread
of being taken in by that formidable hoaxer and
scouted and fooled in the face of a public that was
always only too willing to laugh at the chief-inspector's
mishaps.</p>
<p>This business of the red scarf, in particular,
struck him as most suspicious. It was interesting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152" name="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
certainly, in more ways than one, but so very improbable!
And Lupin's explanation, apparently so
logical, would never stand the test of a severe examination!</p>
<p>"No," said Ganimard, "this is all swank: a
parcel of suppositions and guesswork based upon
nothing at all. I'm not to be caught with chaff."</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>When he reached the headquarters of police,
at 36 Quai des Orfèvres, he had quite made up
his mind to treat the incident as though it had never
happened.</p>
<p>He went up to the Criminal Investigation Department.
Here, one of his fellow-inspectors said:</p>
<p>"Seen the chief?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He was asking for you just now."</p>
<p>"Oh, was he?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you had better go after him."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"To the Rue de Berne ... there was a murder
there last night."</p>
<p>"Oh! Who's the victim?"</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly ... a music-hall singer,
I believe."</p>
<p>Ganimard simply muttered:</p>
<p>"By Jove!"</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later he stepped out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153" name="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
underground railway-station and made for the Rue
de Berne.</p>
<p>The victim, who was known in the theatrical
world by her stage-name of Jenny Saphir, occupied
a small flat on the second floor of one of the houses.
A policeman took the chief-inspector upstairs and
showed him the way, through two sitting-rooms,
to a bedroom, where he found the magistrates in
charge of the inquiry, together with the divisional
surgeon and M. Dudouis, the head of the detective-service.</p>
<p>Ganimard started at the first glance which he
gave into the room. He saw, lying on a sofa, the
corpse of a young woman whose hands clutched a
strip of red silk! One of the shoulders, which
appeared above the low-cut bodice, bore the marks
of two wounds surrounded with clotted blood.
The distorted and almost blackened features still
bore an expression of frenzied terror.</p>
<p>The divisional surgeon, who had just finished his
examination, said:</p>
<p>"My first conclusions are very clear. The victim
was twice stabbed with a dagger and afterward
strangled. The immediate cause of death was asphyxia."</p>
<p>"By Jove!" thought Ganimard again, remembering
Lupin's words and the picture which he had
drawn of the crime.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154" name="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p>The examining-magistrate objected:</p>
<p>"But the neck shows no discoloration."</p>
<p>"She may have been strangled with a napkin
or a handkerchief," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"Most probably," said the chief detective, "with
this silk scarf, which the victim was wearing and a
piece of which remains, as though she had clung to
it with her two hands to protect herself."</p>
<p>"But why does only that piece remain?" asked
the magistrate. "What has become of the
other?"</p>
<p>"The other may have been stained with blood
and carried off by the murderer. You can plainly
distinguish the hurried slashing of the scissors."</p>
<p>"By Jove!" said Ganimard, between his teeth,
for the third time. "That brute of a Lupin saw
everything without seeing a thing!"</p>
<p>"And what about the motive of the murder?"
asked the magistrate. "The locks have been forced,
the cupboards turned upside down. Have you
anything to tell me, M. Dudouis?"</p>
<p>The chief of the detective-service replied:</p>
<p>"I can at least suggest a supposition, derived from
the statements made by the servant. The victim,
who enjoyed a greater reputation on account of
her looks than through her talent as a singer, went
to Russia, two years ago, and brought back with her
a magnificent sapphire, which she appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155" name="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
received from some person of importance at the
court. Since then, she went by the name of Jenny
Saphir and seems generally to have been very proud
of that present, although, for prudence sake, she
never wore it. I daresay that we shall not be far
out if we presume the theft of the sapphire to have
been the cause of the crime."</p>
<p>"But did the maid know where the stone was?"</p>
<p>"No, nobody did. And the disorder of the room
would tend to prove that the murderer did not know
either."</p>
<p>"We will question the maid," said the examining-magistrate.</p>
<p>M. Dudouis took the chief-inspector aside and
said:</p>
<p>"You're looking very old-fashioned, Ganimard.
What's the matter? Do you suspect anything?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all, chief."</p>
<p>"That's a pity. We could do with a bit of showy
work in the department. This is one of a number
of crimes, all of the same class, of which we have
failed to discover the perpetrator. This time we
want the criminal ... and quickly!"</p>
<p>"A difficult job, chief."</p>
<p>"It's got to be done. Listen to me, Ganimard.
According to what the maid says, Jenny Saphir led
a very regular life. For a month past she was in
the habit of frequently receiving visits, on her return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156" name="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
from the music-hall, that is to say, at about half-past
ten, from a man who would stay until midnight
or so. 'He's a society man,' Jenny Saphir
used to say, 'and he wants to marry me.' This
society man took every precaution to avoid being
seen, such as turning up his coat-collar and lowering
the brim of his hat when he passed the porter's box.
And Jenny Saphir always made a point of sending
away her maid, even before he came. This is the
man whom we have to find."</p>
<p>"Has he left no traces?"</p>
<p>"None at all. It is obvious that we have to deal
with a very clever scoundrel, who prepared his
crime beforehand and committed it with every possible
chance of escaping unpunished. His arrest
would be a great feather in our cap. I rely on you,
Ganimard."</p>
<p>"Ah, you rely on me, chief?" replied the inspector.
"Well, we shall see ... we shall see....
I don't say no.... Only...."</p>
<p>He seemed in a very nervous condition, and his
agitation struck M. Dudouis.</p>
<p>"Only," continued Ganimard, "only I swear ...
do you hear, chief? I swear...."</p>
<p>"What do you swear?"</p>
<p>"Nothing.... We shall see, chief ... we shall
see...."</p>
<p>Ganimard did not finish his sentence until he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157" name="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
outside, alone. And he finished it aloud, stamping
his foot, in a tone of the most violent anger:</p>
<p>"Only, I swear to Heaven that the arrest shall
be effected by my own means, without my employing
a single one of the clues with which that villain
has supplied me. Ah, no! Ah, no!..."</p>
<p>Railing against Lupin, furious at being mixed up
in this business and resolved, nevertheless, to get
to the bottom of it, he wandered aimlessly about
the streets. His brain was seething with irritation;
and he tried to adjust his ideas a little and to discover,
among the chaotic facts, some trifling detail,
unperceived by all, unsuspected by Lupin himself,
that might lead him to success.</p>
<p>He lunched hurriedly at a bar, resumed his stroll
and suddenly stopped, petrified, astounded and
confused. He was walking under the gateway of
the very house in the Rue de Surène to which Lupin
had enticed him a few hours earlier! A force
stronger than his own will was drawing him there
once more. The solution of the problem lay there.
There and there alone were all the elements of the
truth. Do and say what he would, Lupin's assertions
were so precise, his calculations so accurate,
that, worried to the innermost recesses of his being
by so prodigious a display of perspicacity, he could
not do other than take up the work at the point
where his enemy had left it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158" name="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>Abandoning all further resistance, he climbed the
three flights of stairs. The door of the flat was
open. No one had touched the exhibits. He put
them in his pocket and walked away.</p>
<p>From that moment, he reasoned and acted, so
to speak, mechanically, under the influence of the
master whom he could not choose but obey.</p>
<p>Admitting that the unknown person whom he
was seeking lived in the neighbourhood of the Pont-Neuf,
it became necessary to discover, somewhere
between that bridge and the Rue de Berne, the
first-class confectioner's shop, open in the evenings,
at which the cakes were bought. This did not take
long to find. A pastry-cook near the Gare Saint-Lazare
showed him some little cardboard boxes,
identical in material and shape with the one in
Ganimard's possession. Moreover, one of the shop-girls
remembered having served, on the previous
evening, a gentleman whose face was almost concealed
in the collar of his fur coat, but whose eyeglass
she had happened to notice.</p>
<p>"That's one clue checked," thought the inspector.
"Our man wears an eyeglass."</p>
<p>He next collected the pieces of the racing-paper
and showed them to a newsvendor, who easily
recognized the <i>Turf Illustré</i>. Ganimard at once
went to the offices of the <i>Turf</i> and asked to see the
list of subscribers. Going through the list, he jotted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159" name="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
down the names and addresses of all those who lived
anywhere near the Pont-Neuf and principally—because
Lupin had said so—those on the left bank
of the river.</p>
<p>He then went back to the Criminal Investigation
Department, took half a dozen men and packed
them off with the necessary instructions.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the evening, the last of these
men returned and brought good news with him.
A certain M. Prévailles, a subscriber to the <i>Turf</i>,
occupied an entresol flat on the Quai des Augustins.
On the previous evening, he left his place, wearing
a fur coat, took his letters and his paper, the <i>Turf
Illustré</i>, from the porter's wife, walked away and
returned home at midnight. This M. Prévailles
wore a single eyeglass. He was a regular race-goer
and himself owned several hacks which he either
rode himself or jobbed out.</p>
<p>The inquiry had taken so short a time and the
results obtained were so exactly in accordance with
Lupin's predictions that Ganimard felt quite overcome
on hearing the detective's report. Once more
he was measuring the prodigious extent of the resources
at Lupin's disposal. Never in the course
of his life—and Ganimard was already well-advanced
in years—had he come across such perspicacity,
such a quick and far-seeing mind.</p>
<p>He went in search of M. Dudouis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160" name="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>"Everything's ready, chief. Have you a warrant?"</p>
<p>"Eh?"</p>
<p>"I said, everything is ready for the arrest,
chief."</p>
<p>"You know the name of Jenny Saphir's murderer?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But how? Explain yourself."</p>
<p>Ganimard had a sort of scruple of conscience,
blushed a little and nevertheless replied:</p>
<p>"An accident, chief. The murderer threw everything
that was likely to compromise him into the
Seine. Part of the parcel was picked up and handed
to me."</p>
<p>"By whom?"</p>
<p>"A boatman who refused to give his name, for
fear of getting into trouble. But I had all the clues
I wanted. It was not so difficult as I expected."</p>
<p>And the inspector described how he had gone to
work.</p>
<p>"And you call that an accident!" cried M. Dudouis.
"And you say that it was not difficult!
Why, it's one of your finest performances! Finish
it yourself, Ganimard, and be prudent."</p>
<p>Ganimard was eager to get the business done.
He went to the Quai des Augustins with his men and
distributed them around the house. He questioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161" name="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the portress, who said that her tenant took his meals
out of doors, but made a point of looking in after
dinner.</p>
<p>A little before nine o'clock, in fact, leaning out
of her window, she warned Ganimard, who at once
gave a low whistle. A gentleman in a tall hat and
a fur coat was coming along the pavement beside
the Seine. He crossed the road and walked up to
the house.</p>
<p>Ganimard stepped forward:</p>
<p>"M. Prévailles, I believe?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but who are you?"</p>
<p>"I have a commission to...."</p>
<p>He had not time to finish his sentence. At the
sight of the men appearing out of the shadow, Prévailles
quickly retreated to the wall and faced his
adversaries, with his back to the door of a shop on
the ground-floor, the shutters of which were closed.</p>
<p>"Stand back!" he cried. "I don't know you!"</p>
<p>His right hand brandished a heavy stick, while
his left was slipped behind him and seemed to be
trying to open the door.</p>
<p>Ganimard had an impression that the man might
escape through this way and through some secret
outlet:</p>
<p>"None of this nonsense," he said, moving closer
to him. "You're caught.... You had better
come quietly."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162" name="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>But, just as he was laying hold of Prévailles'
stick, Ganimard remembered the warning which
Lupin gave him: Prévailles was left-handed; and
it was his revolver for which he was feeling behind
his back.</p>
<p>The inspector ducked his head. He had noticed
the man's sudden movement. Two reports rang
out. No one was hit.</p>
<p>A second later, Prévailles received a blow under
the chin from the butt-end of a revolver, which
brought him down where he stood. He was entered
at the Dépôt soon after nine o'clock.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>Ganimard enjoyed a great reputation even at
that time. But this capture, so quickly effected, by
such very simple means, and at once made public
by the police, won him a sudden celebrity. Prévailles
was forthwith saddled with all the murders
that had remained unpunished; and the newspapers
vied with one another in extolling Ganimard's
prowess.</p>
<p>The case was conducted briskly at the start.
It was first of all ascertained that Prévailles, whose
real name was Thomas Derocq, had already been
in trouble. Moreover, the search instituted in his
rooms, while not supplying any fresh proofs, at
least led to the discovery of a ball of whip-cord
similar to the cord used for doing up the parcel and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163" name="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
also to the discovery of daggers which would have
produced a wound similar to the wounds on the
victim.</p>
<p>But, on the eighth day, everything was changed.
Until then Prévailles had refused to reply to the
questions put to him; but now, assisted by his
counsel, he pleaded a circumstantial alibi and maintained
that he was at the Folies-Bergère on the
night of the murder.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the pockets of his dinner-jacket
contained the counterfoil of a stall-ticket and
a programme of the performance, both bearing the
date of that evening.</p>
<p>"An alibi prepared in advance," objected the
examining-magistrate.</p>
<p>"Prove it," said Prévailles.</p>
<p>The prisoner was confronted with the witnesses
for the prosecution. The young lady from the
confectioner's "thought she knew" the gentleman
with the eyeglass. The hall-porter in the Rue de
Berne "thought he knew" the gentleman who used
to come to see Jenny Saphir. But nobody dared
to make a more definite statement.</p>
<p>The examination, therefore, led to nothing of a
precise character, provided no solid basis whereon
to found a serious accusation.</p>
<p>The judge sent for Ganimard and told him of his
difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164" name="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p>"I can't possibly persist, at this rate. There is
no evidence to support the charge."</p>
<p>"But surely you are convinced in your own mind,
monsieur le juge d'instruction! Prévailles would
never have resisted his arrest unless he was
guilty."</p>
<p>"He says that he thought he was being assaulted.
He also says that he never set eyes on Jenny
Saphir; and, as a matter of fact, we can find
no one to contradict his assertion. Then again,
admitting that the sapphire has been stolen, we
have not been able to find it at his flat."</p>
<p>"Nor anywhere else," suggested Ganimard.</p>
<p>"Quite true, but that is no evidence against him.
I'll tell you what we shall want, M. Ganimard,
and that very soon: the other end of this red
scarf."</p>
<p>"The other end?"</p>
<p>"Yes, for it is obvious that, if the murderer
took it away with him, the reason was that the
stuff is stained with the marks of the blood on his
fingers."</p>
<p>Ganimard made no reply. For several days he
had felt that the whole business was tending to this
conclusion. There was no other proof possible. Given
the silk scarf—and in no other circumstances—Prévailles'
guilt was certain. Now Ganimard's
position required that Prévailles' guilt should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165" name="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
established. He was responsible for the arrest, it
had cast a glamour around him, he had been praised
to the skies as the most formidable adversary of
criminals; and he would look absolutely ridiculous
if Prévailles were released.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the one and only indispensable
proof was in Lupin's pocket. How was he to get
hold of it?</p>
<p>Ganimard cast about, exhausted himself with
fresh investigations, went over the inquiry from
start to finish, spent sleepless nights in turning over
the mystery of the Rue de Berne, studied the records
of Prévailles' life, sent ten men hunting after the
invisible sapphire. Everything was useless.</p>
<p>On the 28th of December, the examining-magistrate
stopped him in one of the passages of the Law
Courts:</p>
<p>"Well, M. Ganimard, any news?"</p>
<p>"No, monsieur le juge d'instruction."</p>
<p>"Then I shall dismiss the case."</p>
<p>"Wait one day longer."</p>
<p>"What's the use? We want the other end of the
scarf; have you got it?"</p>
<p>"I shall have it to-morrow."</p>
<p>"To-morrow!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but please lend me the piece in your
possession."</p>
<p>"What if I do?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166" name="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>"If you do, I promise to let you have the whole
scarf complete."</p>
<p>"Very well, that's understood."</p>
<p>Ganimard followed the examining-magistrate to
his room and came out with the piece of silk:</p>
<p>"Hang it all!" he growled. "Yes, I will go
and fetch the proof and I shall have it too ...
always presuming that Master Lupin has the courage
to keep the appointment."</p>
<p>In point of fact, he did not doubt for a moment
that Master Lupin would have this courage, and
that was just what exasperated him. Why had
Lupin insisted on this meeting? What was his
object, in the circumstances?</p>
<p>Anxious, furious and full of hatred, he resolved
to take every precaution necessary not only to
prevent his falling into a trap himself, but to make
his enemy fall into one, now that the opportunity
offered. And, on the next day, which was the
29th of December, the date fixed by Lupin, after
spending the night in studying the old manor-house
in the Rue de Surène and convincing himself
that there was no other outlet than the front door,
he warned his men that he was going on a dangerous
expedition and arrived with them on the field of
battle.</p>
<p>He posted them in a café and gave them formal
instructions: if he showed himself at one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167" name="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
third-floor windows, or if he failed to return within
an hour, the detectives were to enter the house and
arrest any one who tried to leave it.</p>
<p>The chief-inspector made sure that his revolver
was in working order and that he could take it from
his pocket easily. Then he went upstairs.</p>
<p>He was surprised to find things as he had left
them, the doors open and the locks broken. After
ascertaining that the windows of the principal room
looked out on the street, he visited the three other
rooms that made up the flat. There was no one
there.</p>
<p>"Master Lupin was afraid," he muttered, not
without a certain satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Don't be silly," said a voice behind him.</p>
<p>Turning round, he saw an old workman, wearing
a house-painter's long smock, standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>"You needn't bother your head," said the man.
"It's I, Lupin. I have been working in the painter's
shop since early morning. This is when we knock
off for breakfast. So I came upstairs."</p>
<p>He looked at Ganimard with a quizzing smile and
cried:</p>
<p>"'Pon my word, this is a gorgeous moment
I owe you, old chap! I wouldn't sell it for ten
years of your life; and yet you know how I love
you! What do you think of it, artist? Wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168" name="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
it well thought out and well foreseen? Foreseen
from alpha to omega? Did I understand the
business? Did I penetrate the mystery of the
scarf? I'm not saying that there were no holes
in my argument, no links missing in the chain....
But what a masterpiece of intelligence! Ganimard,
what a reconstruction of events! What an intuition
of everything that had taken place and of everything
that was going to take place, from the discovery
of the crime to your arrival here in search of a
proof! What really marvellous divination! Have
you the scarf?"</p>
<p>"Yes, half of it. Have you the other?"</p>
<p>"Here it is. Let's compare."</p>
<p>They spread the two pieces of silk on the table.
The cuts made by the scissors corresponded exactly.
Moreover, the colours were identical.</p>
<p>"But I presume," said Lupin, "that this was not
the only thing you came for. What you are interested
in seeing is the marks of the blood. Come
with me, Ganimard: it's rather dark in here."</p>
<p>They moved into the next room, which, though
it overlooked the courtyard, was lighter; and
Lupin held his piece of silk against the window-pane:</p>
<p>"Look," he said, making room for Ganimard.</p>
<p>The inspector gave a start of delight. The marks
of the five fingers and the print of the palm were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169" name="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
distinctly visible. The evidence was undeniable.
The murderer had seized the stuff in his bloodstained
hand, in the same hand that had stabbed
Jenny Saphir, and tied the scarf round her neck.</p>
<p>"And it is the print of a left hand," observed
Lupin. "Hence my warning, which had nothing
miraculous about it, you see. For, though I admit,
friend of my youth, that you may look upon me
as a superior intelligence, I won't have you treat
me as a wizard."</p>
<p>Ganimard had quickly pocketed the piece of silk.
Lupin nodded his head in approval:</p>
<p>"Quite right, old boy, it's for you. I'm so
glad you're glad! And, you see, there was no trap
about all this ... only the wish to oblige ... a
service between friends, between pals.... And also,
I confess, a little curiosity.... Yes, I wanted to
examine this other piece of silk, the one the police
had.... Don't be afraid: I'll give it back to
you.... Just a second...."</p>
<p>Lupin, with a careless movement, played with the
tassel at the end of this half of the scarf, while Ganimard
listened to him in spite of himself:</p>
<p>"How ingenious these little bits of women's
work are! Did you notice one detail in the
maid's evidence? Jenny Saphir was very handy
with her needle and used to make all her own hats
and frocks. It is obvious that she made this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170" name="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
scarf herself.... Besides, I noticed that from
the first. I am naturally curious, as I have already
told you, and I made a thorough examination of
the piece of silk which you have just put in your
pocket. Inside the tassel, I found a little sacred
medal, which the poor girl had stitched into it to
bring her luck. Touching, isn't it, Ganimard? A
little medal of Our Lady of Good Succour."</p>
<p>The inspector felt greatly puzzled and did not
take his eyes off the other. And Lupin continued:</p>
<p>"Then I said to myself, 'How interesting it
would be to explore the other half of the scarf, the
one which the police will find round the victim's
neck!' For this other half, which I hold in my
hands at last, is finished off in the same way ...
so I shall be able to see if it has a hiding-place too
and what's inside it.... But look, my friend, isn't
it cleverly made? And so simple! All you have
to do is to take a skein of red cord and braid it round
a wooden cup, leaving a little recess, a little empty
space in the middle, very small, of course, but
large enough to hold a medal of a saint ... or anything....
A precious stone, for instance....
Such as a sapphire...."</p>
<p>At that moment he finished pushing back the
silk cord and, from the hollow of a cup he took
between his thumb and forefinger a wonderful blue
stone, perfect in respect of size and purity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171" name="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ha! What did I tell you, friend of my
youth?"</p>
<p>He raised his head. The inspector had turned
livid and was staring wild-eyed, as though fascinated
by the stone that sparkled before him. He at last
realized the whole plot:</p>
<p>"You dirty scoundrel!" he muttered, repeating
the insults which he had used at the first interview.
"You scum of the earth!"</p>
<p>The two men were standing one against the other.</p>
<p>"Give me back that," said the inspector.</p>
<p>Lupin held out the piece of silk.</p>
<p>"And the sapphire," said Ganimard, in a peremptory
tone.</p>
<p>"Don't be silly."</p>
<p>"Give it back, or...."</p>
<p>"Or what, you idiot!" cried Lupin. "Look
here, do you think I put you on to this soft thing
for nothing?"</p>
<p>"Give it back!"</p>
<p>"You haven't noticed what I've been about, that's
plain! What! For four weeks I've kept you
on the move like a deer; and you want to ...!
Come, Ganimard, old chap, pull yourself together!...
Don't you see that you've been playing the
good dog for four weeks on end?... Fetch it,
Rover!... There's a nice blue pebble over there,
which master can't get at. Hunt it, Ganimard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172" name="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
fetch it ... bring it to master.... Ah, he's his
master's own good little dog!... Sit up! Beg!...
Does'ms want a bit of sugar, then?..."</p>
<p>Ganimard, containing the anger that seethed
within him, thought only of one thing, summoning
his detectives. And, as the room in which he now
was looked out on the courtyard, he tried gradually
to work his way round to the communicating door.
He would then run to the window and break one
of the panes.</p>
<p>"All the same," continued Lupin, "what a pack
of dunderheads you and the rest must be! You've
had the silk all this time and not one of you ever
thought of feeling it, not one of you ever asked
himself the reason why the poor girl hung on to her
scarf. Not one of you! You just acted at haphazard,
without reflecting, without foreseeing anything...."</p>
<p>The inspector had attained his object. Taking
advantage of a second when Lupin had turned away
from him, he suddenly wheeled round and grasped
the door-handle. But an oath escaped him: the
handle did not budge.</p>
<p>Lupin burst into a fit of laughing:</p>
<p>"Not even that! You did not even foresee
that! You lay a trap for me and you won't admit
that I may perhaps smell the thing out beforehand....
And you allow yourself to be brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173" name="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
into this room without asking whether I am not
bringing you here for a particular reason and without
remembering that the locks are fitted with a
special mechanism. Come now, speaking frankly,
what do you think of it yourself?"</p>
<p>"What do I think of it?" roared Ganimard,
beside himself with rage.</p>
<p>He had drawn his revolver and was pointing it
straight at Lupin's face.</p>
<p>"Hands up!" he cried. "That's what I think
of it!"</p>
<p>Lupin placed himself in front of him and shrugged
his shoulders:</p>
<p>"Sold again!" he said.</p>
<p>"Hands up, I say, once more!"</p>
<p>"And sold again, say I. Your deadly weapon
won't go off."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Old Catherine, your housekeeper, is in my service.
She damped the charges this morning while
you were having your breakfast coffee."</p>
<p>Ganimard made a furious gesture, pocketed the
revolver and rushed at Lupin.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Lupin, stopping him short with a
well-aimed kick on the shin.</p>
<p>Their clothes were almost touching. They exchanged
defiant glances, the glances of two adversaries
who mean to come to blows. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174" name="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
there was no fight. The recollection of the earlier
struggles made any present struggle useless. And
Ganimard, who remembered all his past failures,
his vain attacks, Lupin's crushing reprisals, did
not lift a limb. There was nothing to be done.
He felt it. Lupin had forces at his command against
which any individual force simply broke to pieces.
So what was the good?</p>
<p>"I agree," said Lupin, in a friendly voice, as
though answering Ganimard's unspoken thought,
"you would do better to let things be as they are.
Besides, friend of my youth, think of all that this
incident has brought you: fame, the certainty of
quick promotion and, thanks to that, the prospect
of a happy and comfortable old age! Surely, you
don't want the discovery of the sapphire and the
head of poor Arsène Lupin in addition! It wouldn't
be fair. To say nothing of the fact that poor Arsène
Lupin saved your life.... Yes, sir! Who warned
you, at this very spot, that Prévailles was left-handed?...
And is this the way you thank me?
It's not pretty of you, Ganimard. Upon my word,
you make me blush for you!"</p>
<p>While chattering, Lupin had gone through the
same performance as Ganimard and was now near
the door. Ganimard saw that his foe was about
to escape him. Forgetting all prudence, he tried
to block his way and received a tremendous butt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175" name="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in the stomach, which sent him rolling to the opposite
wall.</p>
<p>Lupin dexterously touched a spring, turned the
handle, opened the door and slipped away, roaring
with laughter as he went.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>Twenty minutes later, when Ganimard at last
succeeded in joining his men, one of them said to
him:</p>
<p>"A house-painter left the house, as his mates
were coming back from breakfast, and put a letter
in my hand. 'Give that to your governor,' he
said. 'Which governor?' I asked; but he was
gone. I suppose it's meant for you."</p>
<p>"Let's have it."</p>
<p>Ganimard opened the letter. It was hurriedly
scribbled in pencil and contained these words:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"This is to warn you, friend of my youth, against
excessive credulity. When a fellow tells you that the
cartridges in your revolver are damp, however
great your confidence in that fellow may be, even
though his name be Arsène Lupin, never allow yourself
to be taken in. Fire first; and, if the fellow
hops the twig, you will have acquired the proof
(1) that the cartridges are not damp; and (2) that
old Catherine is the most honest and respectable
of housekeepers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176" name="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>"One of these days, I hope to have the pleasure
of making her acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, friend of my youth, believe me
always affectionately and sincerely yours,</p>
<p style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 30em;">"Arsène Lupin."</p></div>
<hr/>
<h2 class="chapter"><a id="VI" name="VI"></a>VI</h2>
<h3 class="chapter2">SHADOWED BY DEATH</h3>
<p>After he had been round the walls of the property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177" name="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Arsène Lupin returned to the spot from which he
started. It was perfectly clear to him that there
was no breach in the walls; and the only way of
entering the extensive grounds of the Château de
Maupertuis was through a little low door, firmly
bolted on the inside, or through the principal gate,
which was overlooked by the lodge.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "We must employ heroic
methods."</p>
<p>Pushing his way into the copsewood where he
had hidden his motor-bicycle, he unwound a length
of twine from under the saddle and went to a place
which he had noticed in the course of his exploration.
At this place, which was situated far
from the road, on the edge of a wood, a number
of large trees, standing inside the park, overlapped
the wall.</p>
<p>Lupin fastened a stone to the end of the string,
threw it up and caught a thick branch, which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178" name="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
drew down to him and bestraddled. The branch,
in recovering its position, raised him from the ground.
He climbed over the wall, slipped down the tree, and
sprang lightly on the grass.</p>
<p>It was winter; and, through the leafless boughs,
across the undulating lawns, he could see the little
Château de Maupertuis in the distance. Fearing
lest he should be perceived, he concealed himself
behind a clump of fir-trees. From there, with the
aid of a field-glass, he studied the dark and melancholy
front of the manor-house. All the windows
were closed and, as it were, barricaded with solid
shutters. The house might easily have been uninhabited.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" muttered Lupin. "It's not the liveliest
of residences. I shall certainly not come here
to end my days!"</p>
<p>But the clock struck three; one of the doors on
the ground-floor opened; and the figure of a woman
appeared, a very slender figure wrapped in a brown
cloak.</p>
<p>The woman walked up and down for a few minutes
and was at once surrounded by birds, to which she
scattered crumbs of bread. Then she went down
the stone steps that led to the middle lawn and
skirted it, taking the path on the right.</p>
<p>With his field-glass, Lupin could distinctly see
her coming in his direction. She was tall, fair-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179" name="Page_179">[179]</a></span>haired,
graceful in appearance, and seemed to be
quite a young girl. She walked with a sprightly
step, looking at the pale December sun and amusing
herself by breaking the little dead twigs on the shrubs
along the road.</p>
<p>She had gone nearly two thirds of the distance
that separated her from Lupin when there came a
furious sound of barking and a huge dog, a colossal
Danish boarhound, sprang from a neighbouring
kennel and stood erect at the end of the chain by
which it was fastened.</p>
<p>The girl moved a little to one side, without paying
further attention to what was doubtless a daily
incident. The dog grew angrier than ever, standing
on its legs and dragging at its collar, at the risk
of strangling itself.</p>
<p>Thirty or forty steps farther, yielding probably
to an impulse of impatience, the girl turned round
and made a gesture with her hand. The great
Dane gave a start of rage, retreated to the back of
its kennel and rushed out again, this time unfettered.
The girl uttered a cry of mad terror. The dog was
covering the space between them, trailing its broken
chain behind it.</p>
<p>She began to run, to run with all her might, and
screamed out desperately for help. But the dog
came up with her in a few bounds.</p>
<p>She fell, at once exhausted, giving herself up for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180" name="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
lost. The animal was already upon her, almost
touching her.</p>
<p>At that exact moment a shot rang out. The dog
turned a complete somersault, recovered its feet, tore
the ground and then lay down, giving a number of
hoarse, breathless howls, which ended in a dull moan
and an indistinct gurgling. And that was all.</p>
<p>"Dead," said Lupin, who had hastened up at
once, prepared, if necessary, to fire his revolver a
second time.</p>
<p>The girl had risen and stood pale, still staggering.
She looked in great surprise at this man whom she
did not know and who had saved her life; and she
whispered:</p>
<p>"Thank you.... I have had a great fright....
You were in the nick of time.... I
thank you, monsieur."</p>
<p>Lupin took off his hat:</p>
<p>"Allow me to introduce myself, mademoiselle....
My name is Paul Daubreuil.... But
before entering into any explanations, I must ask for
one moment...."</p>
<p>He stooped over the dog's dead body and examined
the chain at the part where the brute's effort had
snapped it:</p>
<p>"That's it," he said, between his teeth. "It's
just as I suspected. By Jupiter, things are moving
rapidly!... I ought to have come earlier."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181" name="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>Returning to the girl's side, he said to her, speaking
very quickly:</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, we have not a minute to lose.
My presence in these grounds is quite irregular.
I do not wish to be surprised here; and this for
reasons that concern yourself alone. Do you think
that the report can have been heard at the house?"</p>
<p>The girl seemed already to have recovered from
her emotion; and she replied, with a calmness that
revealed all her pluck:</p>
<p>"I don't think so."</p>
<p>"Is your father in the house to-day?"</p>
<p>"My father is ill and has been in bed for months.
Besides, his room looks out on the other front."</p>
<p>"And the servants?"</p>
<p>"Their quarters and the kitchen are also on the
other side. No one ever comes to this part. I walk
here myself, but nobody else does."</p>
<p>"It is probable, therefore, that I have not been
seen either, especially as the trees hide us?"</p>
<p>"It is most probable."</p>
<p>"Then I can speak to you freely?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, but I don't understand...."</p>
<p>"You will, presently. Permit me to be brief.
The point is this: four days ago, Mlle. Jeanne
Darcieux...."</p>
<p>"That is my name," she said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Mlle. Jeanne Darcieux," continued Lupin, "wrote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182" name="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a letter to one of her friends, called Marceline, who
lives at Versailles...."</p>
<p>"How do you know all that?" asked the girl, in
astonishment. "I tore up the letter before I had
finished it."</p>
<p>"And you flung the pieces on the edge of the road
that runs from the house to Vendôme."</p>
<p>"That's true.... I had gone out walking...."</p>
<p>"The pieces were picked up and they came into
my hands next day."</p>
<p>"Then ... you must have read them," said
Jeanne Darcieux, betraying a certain annoyance by
her manner.</p>
<p>"Yes, I committed that indiscretion; and I do not
regret it, because I can save you."</p>
<p>"Save me? From what?"</p>
<p>"From death."</p>
<p>Lupin spoke this little sentence in a very distinct
voice. The girl gave a shudder. Then she said:</p>
<p>"I am not threatened with death."</p>
<p>"Yes, you are, mademoiselle. At the end of
October, you were reading on a bench on the terrace
where you were accustomed to sit at the same hour
every day, when a block of stone fell from the cornice
above your head and you were within a few inches
of being crushed."</p>
<p>"An accident...."</p>
<p>"One fine evening in November, you were walking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183" name="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
in the kitchen-garden, by moonlight. A shot was
fired, The bullet whizzed past your ear."</p>
<p>"At least, I thought so."</p>
<p>"Lastly, less than a week ago, the little wooden
bridge that crosses the river in the park, two yards
from the waterfall, gave way while you were on it.
You were just able, by a miracle, to catch hold of the
root of a tree."</p>
<p>Jeanne Darcieux tried to smile.</p>
<p>"Very well. But, as I wrote to Marceline, these
are only a series of coincidences, of accidents...."</p>
<p>"No, mademoiselle, no. One accident of this
sort is allowable.... So are two ... and
even then!... But we have no right to suppose
that the chapter of accidents, repeating the same act
three times in such different and extraordinary circumstances,
is a mere amusing coincidence. That
is why I thought that I might presume to come
to your assistance. And, as my intervention can
be of no use unless it remains secret, I did not hesitate
to make my way in here ... without
walking through the gate. I came in the nick of
time, as you said. Your enemy was attacking you
once more."</p>
<p>"What!... Do you think?... No, it
is impossible.... I refuse to believe...."</p>
<p>Lupin picked up the chain and, showing it to
her:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184" name="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>"Look at the last link. There is no question
but that it has been filed. Otherwise, so powerful
a chain as this would never have yielded. Besides,
you can see the mark of the file here."</p>
<p>Jeanne turned pale and her pretty features were
distorted with terror:</p>
<p>"But who can bear me such a grudge?" she gasped.
"It is terrible.... I have never done any one
harm.... And yet you are certainly right....
Worse still...."</p>
<p>She finished her sentence in a lower voice:</p>
<p>"Worse still, I am wondering whether the same
danger does not threaten my father."</p>
<p>"Has he been attacked also?"</p>
<p>"No, for he never stirs from his room. But his
is such a mysterious illness!... He has no
strength ... he cannot walk at all.... In
addition to that, he is subject to fits of suffocation,
as though his heart stopped beating.... Oh,
what an awful thing!"</p>
<p>Lupin realized all the authority which he was able
to assert at such a moment, and he said:</p>
<p>"Have no fear, mademoiselle. If you obey me
blindly, I shall be sure to succeed."</p>
<p>"Yes ... yes ... I am quite willing
... but all this is so terrible...."</p>
<p>"Trust me, I beg of you. And please listen to me,
I shall want a few particulars."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185" name="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p>He rapped out a number of questions, which Jeanne
Darcieux answered hurriedly:</p>
<p>"That animal was never let loose, was he?"</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>"Who used to feed him?"</p>
<p>"The lodge-keeper. He brought him his food
every evening."</p>
<p>"Consequently, he could go near him without being
bitten?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and he only, for the dog was very
savage."</p>
<p>"You don't suspect the man?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no!... Baptiste?... Never!"</p>
<p>"And you can't think of anybody?"</p>
<p>"No. Our servants are quite devoted to us. They
are very fond of me."</p>
<p>"You have no friends staying in the house?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"No brother?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then your father is your only protector?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and I have told you the condition he is
in."</p>
<p>"Have you told him of the different attempts?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and it was wrong of me to do so. Our
doctor, old Dr. Guéroult, forbade me to cause him
the least excitement."</p>
<p>"Your mother?..."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186" name="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't remember her. She died sixteen years
ago ... just sixteen years ago."</p>
<p>"How old were you then?"</p>
<p>"I was not quite five years old."</p>
<p>"And were you living here?"</p>
<p>"We were living in Paris. My father only bought
this place the year after."</p>
<p>Lupin was silent for a few moments. Then he
concluded:</p>
<p>"Very well, mademoiselle, I am obliged to you.
Those particulars are all I need for the present.
Besides, it would not be wise for us to remain together
longer."</p>
<p>"But," she said, "the lodge-keeper will find the
dog soon.... Who will have killed him?"</p>
<p>"You, mademoiselle, to defend yourself against an
attack."</p>
<p>"I never carry firearms."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you do," said Lupin, smiling, "because
you killed the dog and there is no one but
you who could have killed him. For that matter,
let them think what they please. The great thing
is that I shall not be suspected when I come to the
house."</p>
<p>"To the house? Do you intend to?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I don't yet know how ... But I shall come....
This very evening.... So, once more, be
easy in your mind. I will answer for everything."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187" name="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>Jeanne looked at him and, dominated by him, conquered
by his air of assurance and good faith, she
said, simply:</p>
<p>"I am quite easy."</p>
<p>"Then all will go well. Till this evening, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"Till this evening."</p>
<p>She walked away; and Lupin, following her with
his eyes until the moment when she disappeared round
the corner of the house, murmured:</p>
<p>"What a pretty creature! It would be a pity if
any harm were to come to her. Luckily, Arsène
Lupin is keeping his weather-eye open."</p>
<p>Taking care not to be seen, with eyes and ears
attentive to the least sight or sound, he inspected
every nook and corner of the grounds, looked for the
little low door which he had noticed outside and
which was the door of the kitchen garden, drew the
bolt, took the key and then skirted the walls and
found himself once more near the tree which he had
climbed. Two minutes later, he was mounting his
motor-cycle.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>The village of Maupertuis lay quite close to the
estate. Lupin inquired and learnt that Dr. Guéroult
lived next door to the church.</p>
<p>He rang, was shown into the consulting-room and
introduced himself by his name of Paul Daubreuil,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188" name="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of the Rue de Surène, Paris, adding that he had
official relations with the detective-service, a fact
which he requested might be kept secret. He had
become acquainted, by means of a torn letter, with
the incidents that had endangered Mlle. Darcieux's
life; and he had come to that young lady's assistance.</p>
<p>Dr. Guéroult, an old country practitioner, who
idolized Jeanne, on hearing Lupin's explanations
at once admitted that those incidents constituted
undeniable proofs of a plot. He showed great
concern, offered his visitor hospitality and kept him
to dinner.</p>
<p>The two men talked at length. In the evening,
they walked round to the manor-house together.</p>
<p>The doctor went to the sick man's room, which was
on the first floor, and asked leave to bring up a young
colleague, to whom he intended soon to make over
his practice, when he retired.</p>
<p>Lupin, on entering, saw Jeanne Darcieux seated
by her father's bedside. She suppressed a movement
of surprise and, at a sign from the doctor, left
the room.</p>
<p>The consultation thereupon took place in Lupin's
presence. M. Darcieux's face was worn, with much
suffering and his eyes were bright with fever. He
complained particularly, that day, of his heart. After
the auscultation, he questioned the doctor with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189" name="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
obvious anxiety; and each reply seemed to give him
relief. He also spoke of Jeanne and expressed his
conviction that they were deceiving him and that
his daughter had escaped yet more accidents. He
continued perturbed, in spite of the doctor's denials.
He wanted to have the police informed and inquiries
set on foot.</p>
<p>But his excitement tired him and he gradually
dropped off to sleep.</p>
<p>Lupin stopped the doctor in the passage:</p>
<p>"Come, doctor, give me your exact opinion. Do
you think that M. Darcieux's illness can be attributed
to an outside cause?"</p>
<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, suppose that the same enemy should be interested
in removing both father and daughter."</p>
<p>The doctor seemed struck by the suggestion.</p>
<p>"Upon my word, there is something in what you
say.... The father's illness at times adopts such
a very unusual character!... For instance, the
paralysis of the legs, which is almost complete, ought
to be accompanied by...."</p>
<p>The doctor reflected for a moment and then said
in a low voice:</p>
<p>"You think it's poison, of course ... but
what poison?... Besides, I see no toxic symptoms....
It would have to be.... But
what are you doing? What's the matter?..."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190" name="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<p>The two men were talking outside a little sitting-room
on the first floor, where Jeanne, seizing the
opportunity while the doctor was with her father,
had begun her evening meal. Lupin, who was watching
her through the open door, saw her lift a cup to her
lips and take a few sups.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he rushed at her and caught her by the
arm:</p>
<p>"What are you drinking there?"</p>
<p>"Why," she said, taken aback, "only tea!"</p>
<p>"You pulled a face of disgust ... what made
you do that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know ... I thought...."</p>
<p>"You thought what?"</p>
<p>"That ... that it tasted rather bitter....
But I expect that comes from the medicine
I mixed with it."</p>
<p>"What medicine?"</p>
<p>"Some drops which I take at dinner ... the
drops which you prescribed for me, you know,
doctor."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dr. Guéroult, "but that medicine
has no taste of any kind.... You know it
hasn't, Jeanne, for you have been taking it for a fortnight
and this is the first time...."</p>
<p>"Quite right," said the girl, "and this does have a
taste.... There—oh!—my mouth is still burning."</p>
<p>Dr. Guéroult now took a sip from the cup;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191" name="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>"Faugh!" he exclaimed, spitting it out again.
"There's no mistake about it...."</p>
<p>Lupin, on his side, was examining the bottle containing
the medicine; and he asked:</p>
<p>"Where is this bottle kept in the daytime?"</p>
<p>But Jeanne was unable to answer. She had put
her hand to her heart and, wan-faced, with staring
eyes, seemed to be suffering great pain:</p>
<p>"It hurts ... it hurts," she stammered.</p>
<p>The two men quickly carried her to her room and
laid her on the bed:</p>
<p>"She ought to have an emetic," said Lupin.</p>
<p>"Open the cupboard," said the doctor. "You'll
see a medicine-case.... Have you got it?...
Take out one of those little tubes.... Yes, that
one.... And now some hot water.... You'll
find some on the tea-tray in the other room."</p>
<p>Jeanne's own maid came running up in answer to
the bell. Lupin told her that Mlle. Darcieux had
been taken unwell, for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>He next returned to the little dining-room,
inspected the sideboard and the cupboards, went
down to the kitchen and pretended that the doctor
had sent him to ask about M. Darcieux's diet.
Without appearing to do so, he catechized the cook,
the butler, and Baptiste, the lodge-keeper, who had
his meals at the manor-house with the servants.
Then he went back to the doctor:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192" name="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"She's asleep."</p>
<p>"Any danger?"</p>
<p>"No. Fortunately, she had only taken two or
three sips. But this is the second time to-day that
you have saved her life, as the analysis of this bottle
will show."</p>
<p>"Quite superfluous to make an analysis, doctor.
There is no doubt about the fact that there has been
an attempt at poisoning."</p>
<p>"By whom?"</p>
<p>"I can't say. But the demon who is engineering all
this business clearly knows the ways of the house.
He comes and goes as he pleases, walks about in the
park, files the dog's chain, mixes poison with the
food and, in short, moves and acts precisely as though
he were living the very life of her—or rather of those—whom
he wants to put away."</p>
<p>"Ah! You really believe that M. Darcieux is
threatened with the same danger?"</p>
<p>"I have not a doubt of it."</p>
<p>"Then it must be one of the servants? But
that is most unlikely! Do you think ...?"</p>
<p>"I think nothing, doctor. I know nothing. All
I can say is that the situation is most tragic and that
we must be prepared for the worst. Death is here,
doctor, shadowing the people in this house; and it will
soon strike at those whom it is pursuing."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193" name="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>"What's to be done?"</p>
<p>"Watch, doctor. Let us pretend that we are
alarmed about M. Darcieux's health and spend the
night in here. The bedrooms of both the father and
daughter are close by. If anything happens, we are
sure to hear."</p>
<p>There was an easy-chair in the room. They
arranged to sleep in it turn and turn about.</p>
<p>In reality, Lupin slept for only two or three hours.
In the middle of the night he left the room, without
disturbing his companion, carefully looked round
the whole of the house and walked out through the
principal gate.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>He reached Paris on his motor-cycle at nine o'clock
in the morning. Two of his friends, to whom he
telephoned on the road, met him there. They all
three spent the day in making searches which Lupin
had planned out beforehand.</p>
<p>He set out again hurriedly at six o'clock; and never,
perhaps, as he told me subsequently, did he risk
his life with greater temerity than in his breakneck
ride, at a mad rate of speed, on a foggy December
evening, with the light of his lamp hardly able to
pierce through the darkness.</p>
<p>He sprang from his bicycle outside the gate, which
was still open, ran to the house and reached the first
floor in a few bounds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194" name="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>There was no one in the little dining-room.</p>
<p>Without hesitating, without knocking, he walked
into Jeanne's bedroom:</p>
<p>"Ah, here you are!" he said, with a sigh of relief,
seeing Jeanne and the doctor sitting side by side,
talking.</p>
<p>"What? Any news?" asked the doctor, alarmed
at seeing such a state of agitation in a man whose
coolness he had had occasion to observe.</p>
<p>"No," said Lupin. "No news. And here?"</p>
<p>"None here, either. We have just left M. Darcieux.
He has had an excellent day and he ate his
dinner with a good appetite. As for Jeanne, you
can see for yourself, she has all her pretty colour back
again."</p>
<p>"Then she must go."</p>
<p>"Go? But it's out of the question!" protested
the girl.</p>
<p>"You must go, you must!" cried Lupin, with real
violence, stamping his foot on the floor.</p>
<p>He at once mastered himself, spoke a few words
of apology and then, for three or four minutes, preserved
a complete silence, which the doctor and
Jeanne were careful not to disturb.</p>
<p>At last, he said to the young girl:</p>
<p>"You shall go to-morrow morning, mademoiselle.
It will be only for one or two weeks. I will take
you to your friend at Versailles, the one to whom you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195" name="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
were writing. I entreat you to get everything ready
to-night ... without concealment of any kind.
Let the servants know that you are going....
On the other hand, the doctor will be good enough to
tell M. Darcieux and give him to understand, with
every possible precaution, that this journey is
essential to your safety. Besides, he can join you
as soon as his strength permits.... That's settled,
is it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, absolutely dominated by Lupin's
gentle and imperious voice.</p>
<p>"In that case," he said, "be as quick as you can ...
and do not stir from your room...."</p>
<p>"But," said the girl, with a shudder, "am I to stay
alone to-night?"</p>
<p>"Fear nothing. Should there be the least danger,
the doctor and I will come back. Do not open your
door unless you hear three very light taps."</p>
<p>Jeanne at once rang for her maid. The doctor
went to M. Darcieux, while Lupin had some supper
brought to him in the little dining-room.</p>
<p>"That's done," said the doctor, returning to him
in twenty minutes' time. "M. Darcieux did not
raise any great difficulty. As a matter of fact, he
himself thinks it just as well that we should send
Jeanne away."</p>
<p>They then went downstairs together and left the
house.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196" name="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>On reaching the lodge, Lupin called the keeper.</p>
<p>"You can shut the gate, my man. If M. Darcieux
should want us, send for us at once."</p>
<p>The clock of Maupertuis church struck ten. The
sky was overcast with black clouds, through which
the moon broke at moments.</p>
<p>The two men walked on for sixty or seventy
yards.</p>
<p>They were nearing the village, when Lupin gripped
his companion by the arm:</p>
<p>"Stop!"</p>
<p>"What on earth's the matter?" exclaimed the
doctor.</p>
<p>"The matter is this," Lupin jerked out, "that,
if my calculations turn out right, if I have not misjudged
the business from start to finish, Mlle. Darcieux
will be murdered before the night is out."</p>
<p>"Eh? What's that?" gasped the doctor, in dismay.
"But then why did we go?"</p>
<p>"With the precise object that the miscreant, who
is watching all our movements in the dark, may not
postpone his crime and may perpetrate it, not at
the hour chosen by himself, but at the hour which I
have decided upon."</p>
<p>"Then we are returning to the manor-house?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course we are, but separately."</p>
<p>"In that case, let us go at once."</p>
<p>"Listen to me, doctor," said Lupin, in a steady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197" name="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
voice, "and let us waste no time in useless words.
Above all, we must defeat any attempt to watch us.
You will therefore go straight home and not come
out again until you are quite certain that you have
not been followed. You will then make for the
walls of the property, keeping to the left, till you
come to the little door of the kitchen-garden. Here
is the key. When the church clock strikes eleven,
open the door very gently and walk right up to the
terrace at the back of the house. The fifth window
is badly fastened. You have only to climb over the
balcony. As soon as you are inside Mlle. Darcieux's
room, bolt the door and don't budge. You quite
understand, don't budge, either of you, whatever
happens. I have noticed that Mlle. Darcieux leaves
her dressing-room window ajar, isn't that so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a habit which I taught her."</p>
<p>"That's the way they'll come."</p>
<p>"And you?"</p>
<p>"That's the way I shall come also."</p>
<p>"And do you know who the villain is?"</p>
<p>Lupin hesitated and then replied:</p>
<p>"No, I don't know.... And that is just how we
shall find out. But, I implore you, keep cool. Not a
word, not a movement, <i>whatever happens</i>!"</p>
<p>"I promise you."</p>
<p>"I want more than that, doctor. You must give
me your word of honour."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198" name="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>"I give you my word of honour."</p>
<p>The doctor went away. Lupin at once climbed
a neighbouring mound from which he could see the
windows of the first and second floor. Several of
them were lighted.</p>
<p>He waited for some little time. The lights went
out one by one. Then, taking a direction opposite
to that in which the doctor had gone, he branched
off to the right and skirted the wall until he came to
the clump of trees near which he had hidden his
motor-cycle on the day before.</p>
<p>Eleven o'clock struck. He calculated the time
which it would take the doctor to cross the kitchen-garden
and make his way into the house.</p>
<p>"That's one point scored!" he muttered.
"Everything's all right on that side. And now,
Lupin to the rescue? The enemy won't be long
before he plays his last trump ... and, by all
the gods, I must be there!..."</p>
<p>He went through the same performance as on
the first occasion, pulled down the branch and
hoisted himself to the top of the wall, from
which he was able to reach the bigger boughs of the
tree.</p>
<p>Just then he pricked up his ears. He seemed to
hear a rustling of dead leaves. And he actually
perceived a dark form moving on the level thirty
yards away:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199" name="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hang it all!" he said to himself. "I'm done: the
scoundrel has smelt a rat."</p>
<p>A moonbeam pierced through the clouds. Lupin
distinctly saw the man take aim. He tried to jump
to the ground and turned his head. But he felt
something hit him in the chest, heard the sound of a
report, uttered an angry oath and came crashing down
from branch to branch, like a corpse.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>Meanwhile, Doctor Guéroult, following Arsène Lupin's
instructions, had climbed the ledge of the fifth
window and groped his way to the first floor. On
reaching Jeanne's room, he tapped lightly, three
times, at the door and, immediately on entering,
pushed the bolt:</p>
<p>"Lie down at once," he whispered to the girl,
who had not taken off her things. "You must
appear to have gone to bed. Brrrr, it's cold in here!
Is the window open in your dressing-room?"</p>
<p>"Yes ... would you like me to ...?"</p>
<p>"No, leave it as it is. They are coming."</p>
<p>"They are coming!" spluttered Jeanne, in affright.</p>
<p>"Yes, beyond a doubt."</p>
<p>"But who? Do you suspect any one?"</p>
<p>"I don't know who.... I expect that there is
some one hidden in the house ... or in the park."</p>
<p>"Oh, I feel so frightened!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200" name="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't be frightened. The sportsman who's
looking after you seems jolly clever and makes a
point of playing a safe game. I expect he's on the
look-out in the court."</p>
<p>The doctor put out the night-light, went to the
window and raised the blind. A narrow cornice, running
along the first story, prevented him from seeing
more than a distant part of the courtyard; and he
came back and sat down by the bed.</p>
<p>Some very painful minutes passed, minutes that
appeared to them interminably long. The clock
in the village struck; but, taken up as they were
with all the little noises of the night, they hardly noticed
the sound. They listened, listened, with all
their nerves on edge:</p>
<p>"Did you hear?" whispered the doctor.</p>
<p>"Yes ... yes," said Jeanne, sitting up in bed.</p>
<p>"Lie down ... lie down," he said, presently.
"There's some one coming."</p>
<p>There was a little tapping sound outside, against
the cornice. Next came a series of indistinct noises,
the nature of which they could not make out for
certain. But they had a feeling that the window in
the dressing-room was being opened wider, for they
were buffeted by gusts of cold air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it became quite clear: there was some
one next door.</p>
<p>The doctor, whose hand was trembling a little,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201" name="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
seized his revolver. Nevertheless, he did not move,
remembering the formal orders which he had received
and fearing to act against them.</p>
<p>The room was in absolute darkness; and they
were unable to see where the adversary was. But
they felt his presence.</p>
<p>They followed his invisible movements, the sound
of his footsteps deadened by the carpet; and they
did not doubt but that he had already crossed the
threshold of the room.</p>
<p>And the adversary stopped. Of that they were
certain. He was standing six steps away from the
bed, motionless, undecided perhaps, seeking to pierce
the darkness with his keen eyes.</p>
<p>Jeanne's hand, icy-cold and clammy, trembled in
the doctor's grasp.</p>
<p>With his other hand, the doctor clutched his
revolver, with his finger on the trigger. In spite of
his pledged word, he did not hesitate. If the adversary
touched the end of the bed, the shot would be
fired at a venture.</p>
<p>The adversary took another step and then stopped
again. And there was something awful about that
silence, that impassive silence, that darkness in
which those human beings were peering at one
another, wildly.</p>
<p>Who was it looming in the murky darkness?
Who was the man? What horrible enmity was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202" name="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
it that turned his hand against the girl and what
abominable aim was he pursuing?</p>
<p>Terrified though they were, Jeanne and the doctor
thought only of that one thing: to see, to learn the
truth, to gaze upon the adversary's face.</p>
<p>He took one more step and did not move again.
It seemed to them that his figure stood out, darker,
against the dark space and that his arm rose slowly,
slowly....</p>
<p>A minute passed and then another minute....</p>
<p>And, suddenly, beyond the man, on the right a
sharp click.... A bright light flashed, was flung
upon the man, lit him full in the face, remorselessly.</p>
<p>Jeanne gave a cry of affright. She had seen—standing
over her, with a dagger in his hand—she
had seen ... her father!</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, though the light was
already turned off, there came a report: the doctor
had fired.</p>
<p>"Dash it all, don't shoot!" roared Lupin.</p>
<p>He threw his arms round the doctor, who choked
out:</p>
<p>"Didn't you see?... Didn't you see?...
Listen!... He's escaping!..."</p>
<p>"Let him escape: it's the best thing that could
happen."</p>
<p>He pressed the spring of his electric lantern again,
ran to the dressing-room, made certain that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203" name="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
man had disappeared and, returning quietly to the
table, lit the lamp.</p>
<p>Jeanne lay on her bed, pallid, in a dead faint.</p>
<p>The doctor, huddled in his chair, emitted inarticulate
sounds.</p>
<p>"Come," said Lupin, laughing, "pull yourself
together. There is nothing to excite ourselves about:
it's all over."</p>
<p>"Her father!... Her father!" moaned the
old doctor.</p>
<p>"If you please, doctor, Mlle. Darcieux is ill. Look
after her."</p>
<p>Without more words, Lupin went back to the
dressing-room and stepped out on the window-ledge.
A ladder stood against the ledge. He ran down it.
Skirting the wall of the house, twenty steps farther,
he tripped over the rungs of a rope-ladder, which he
climbed and found himself in M. Darcieux's bedroom.
The room was empty.</p>
<p>"Just so," he said. "My gentleman did not
like the position and has cleared out. Here's
wishing him a good journey.... And, of course,
the door is bolted?... Exactly!... That
is how our sick man, tricking his worthy medical
attendant, used to get up at night in full security,
fasten his rope-ladder to the balcony and prepare his
little games. He's no fool, is friend Darcieux!"</p>
<p>He drew the bolts and returned to Jeanne's room.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204" name="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
The doctor, who was just coming out of the doorway,
drew him to the little dining-room:</p>
<p>"She's asleep, don't let us disturb her. She has
had a bad shock and will take some time to recover."</p>
<p>Lupin poured himself out a glass of water and drank
it down. Then he took a chair and, calmly:</p>
<p>"Pooh! She'll be all right by to-morrow."</p>
<p>"What do you say?"</p>
<p>"I say that she'll be all right by to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"In the first place, because it did not strike me
that Mlle. Darcieux felt any very great affection for
her father."</p>
<p>"Never mind! Think of it: a father who tries
to kill his daughter! A father who, for months on
end, repeats his monstrous attempt four, five, six
times over again!... Well, isn't that enough to
blight a less sensitive soul than Jeanne's for good and
all? What a hateful memory!"</p>
<p>"She will forget."</p>
<p>"One does not forget such a thing as that."</p>
<p>"She will forget, doctor, and for a very simple
reason...."</p>
<p>"Explain yourself!"</p>
<p>"She is not M. Darcieux's daughter!"</p>
<p>"Eh?"</p>
<p>"I repeat, she is not that villain's daughter."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? M. Darcieux...."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205" name="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>"M. Darcieux is only her step-father. She had
just been born when her father, her real father, died.
Jeanne's mother then married a cousin of her husband's,
a man bearing the same name, and she died
within a year of her second wedding. She left Jeanne
in M. Darcieux's charge. He first took her abroad
and then bought this country-house; and, as nobody
knew him in the neighbourhood, he represented the
child as being his daughter. She herself did not know
the truth about her birth."</p>
<p>The doctor sat confounded. He asked:</p>
<p>"Are you sure of your facts?"</p>
<p>"I spent my day in the town-halls of the Paris
municipalities. I searched the registers, I interviewed
two solicitors, I have seen all the documents.
There is no doubt possible."</p>
<p>"But that does not explain the crime, or rather the
series of crimes."</p>
<p>"Yes, it does," declared Lupin. "And, from
the start, from the first hour when I meddled in this
business, some words which Mlle. Darcieux used
made me suspect that direction which my investigations
must take. 'I was not quite five years old
when my mother died,' she said. 'That was sixteen
years ago.' Mlle. Darcieux, therefore, was nearly
twenty-one, that is to say, she was on the verge of
attaining her majority. I at once saw that this
was an important detail. The day on which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206" name="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
reach your majority is the day on which your accounts
are rendered. What was the financial position
of Mlle. Darcieux, who was her mother's natural
heiress? Of course, I did not think of the father
for a second. To begin with, one can't imagine
a thing like that; and then the farce which
M. Darcieux was playing ... helpless, bedridden,
ill...."</p>
<p>"Really ill," interrupted the doctor.</p>
<p>"All this diverted suspicion from him ... the
more so as I believe that he himself was exposed
to criminal attacks. But was there not in the family
some person who would be interested in their removal?
My journey to Paris revealed the truth
to me: Mlle. Darcieux inherits a large fortune from
her mother, of which her step-father draws the
income. The solicitor was to have called a meeting
of the family in Paris next month. The truth would
have been out. It meant ruin to M. Darcieux."</p>
<p>"Then he had put no money by?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but he had lost a great deal as the result of
unfortunate speculations."</p>
<p>"But, after all, Jeanne would not have taken the
management of her fortune out of his hands!"</p>
<p>"There is one detail which you do not know,
doctor, and which I learnt from reading the torn
letter. Mlle. Darcieux is in love with the brother
of Marceline, her Versailles friend; M. Darcieux<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207" name="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was opposed to the marriage; and—you now see the
reason—she was waiting until she came of age to
be married."</p>
<p>"You're right," said the doctor, "you're right....
It meant his ruin."</p>
<p>"His absolute ruin. One chance of saving himself
remained, the death of his step-daughter, of whom he
is the next heir."</p>
<p>"Certainly, but on condition that no one suspected
him."</p>
<p>"Of course; and that is why he contrived the series
of accidents, so that the death might appear to be
due to misadventure. And that is why I, on my
side, wishing to bring things to a head, asked you
to tell him of Mlle. Darcieux's impending departure.
From that moment, it was no longer enough
for the would-be sick man to wander about the
grounds and the passages, in the dark, and execute
some leisurely thought-out plan. No, he had to
act, to act at once, without preparation, violently,
dagger in hand. I had no doubt that he would
decide to do it. And he did."</p>
<p>"Then he had no suspicions?"</p>
<p>"Of me, yes. He felt that I would return to-night,
and he kept a watch at the place where I had already
climbed the wall."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well," said Lupin, laughing, "I received a bullet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208" name="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
full in the chest ... or rather my pocket-book
received a bullet.... Here, you can see the hole....
So I tumbled from the tree, like a dead man.
Thinking that he was rid of his only adversary, he
went back to the house. I saw him prowl about for
two hours. Then, making up his mind, he went to
the coach-house, took a ladder and set it against the
window. I had only to follow him."</p>
<p>The doctor reflected and said:</p>
<p>"You could have collared him earlier. Why did
you let him come up? It was a sore trial for Jeanne ...
and unnecessary."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, it was indispensable! Mlle.
Darcieux would never have accepted the truth.
It was essential that she should see the murderer's
very face. You must tell her all the circumstances
when she wakes. She will soon be well again."</p>
<p>"But ... M. Darcieux?"</p>
<p>"You can explain his disappearance as you think
best ... a sudden journey ... a fit of
madness.... There will be a few inquiries....
And you may be sure that he will never be
heard of again."</p>
<p>The doctor nodded his head:</p>
<p>"Yes ... that is so ... that is so ...
you are right. You have managed all this
business with extraordinary skill; and Jeanne owes you
her life. She will thank you in person.... But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209" name="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
now, can I be of use to you in any way? You
told me that you were connected with the detective-service....
Will you allow me to write and
praise your conduct, your courage?"</p>
<p>Lupin began to laugh:</p>
<p>"Certainly! A letter of that kind will do me a
world of good. You might write to my immediate
superior, Chief-inspector Ganimard. He will be
glad to hear that his favourite officer, Paul Daubreuil,
of the Rue de Surène, has once again distinguished
himself by a brilliant action. As it happens, I have
an appointment to meet him about a case of which
you may have heard: the case of the red scarf....
How pleased my dear M. Ganimard will be!"</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">A TRAGEDY IN THE FOREST OF
MORGUES</h3>
<p>The village was terror-stricken.</p>
<p>It was on a Sunday morning. The peasants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210" name="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Saint-Nicolas and the neighbourhood were coming
out of church and spreading across the square, when,
suddenly, the women who were walking ahead and
who had already turned into the high-road fell back
with loud cries of dismay.</p>
<p>At the same moment, an enormous motor-car,
looking like some appalling monster, came tearing
into sight at a headlong rate of speed. Amid the
shouts of the madly scattering people, it made
straight for the church, swerved, just as it seemed
about to dash itself to pieces against the steps,
grazed the wall of the presbytery, regained the
continuation of the national road, dashed along,
turned the corner and disappeared, without, by
some incomprehensible miracle, having so much as
brushed against any of the persons crowding the
square.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211" name="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p>But they had seen! They had seen a man in the
driver's seat, wrapped in a goat-skin coat, with a
fur cap on his head and his face disguised in a pair
of large goggles, and, with him, on the front of
that seat, flung back, bent in two, a woman whose
head, all covered with blood, hung down over the
bonnet....</p>
<p>And they had heard! They had heard the
woman's screams, screams of horror, screams of
agony....</p>
<p>And it was all such a vision of hell and carnage
that the people stood, for some seconds, motionless,
stupefied.</p>
<p>"Blood!" roared somebody.</p>
<p>There was blood everywhere, on the cobblestones
of the square, on the ground hardened by
the first frosts of autumn; and, when a number
of men and boys rushed off in pursuit of the motor,
they had but to take those sinister marks for their
guide.</p>
<p>The marks, on their part, followed the high-road,
but in a very strange manner, going from one side
to the other and leaving a zigzag track, in the wake
of the tires, that made those who saw it shudder.
How was it that the car had not bumped against
that tree? How had it been righted, instead of
smashing into that bank? What novice, what
madman, what drunkard, what frightened criminal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212" name="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was driving that motor-car with such astounding
bounds and swerves?</p>
<p>One of the peasants declared:</p>
<p>"They will never do the turn in the forest."</p>
<p>And another said:</p>
<p>"Of course they won't! She's bound to upset!"</p>
<p>The Forest of Morgues began at half a mile beyond
Saint-Nicolas; and the road, which was
straight up to that point, except for a slight
bend where it left the village, started climbing,
immediately after entering the forest, and made
an abrupt turn among the rocks and trees. No
motor-car was able to take this turn without first
slackening speed. There were posts to give notice
of the danger.</p>
<p>The breathless peasants reached the quincunx of
beeches that formed the edge of the forest. And one
of them at once cried:</p>
<p>"There you are!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Upset!"</p>
<p>The car, a limousine, had turned turtle and lay
smashed, twisted and shapeless. Beside it, the
woman's dead body. But the most horrible, sordid,
stupefying thing was the woman's head, crushed,
flattened, invisible under a block of stone, a huge
block of stone lodged there by some unknown and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213" name="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
prodigious agency. As for the man in the goat-skin
coat he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>He was not found on the scene of the accident.
He was not found either in the neighbourhood.
Moreover, some workmen coming down the Côte
de Morgues declared that they had not seen anybody.</p>
<p>The man, therefore, had taken refuge in the
woods.</p>
<p>The gendarmes, who were at once sent for, made a
minute search, assisted by the peasants, but discovered
nothing. In the same way, the examining-magistrates,
after a close inquiry lasting for several
days, found no clue capable of throwing the least
light upon this inscrutable tragedy. On the contrary,
the investigations only led to further mysteries
and further improbabilities.</p>
<p>Thus it was ascertained that the block of stone
came from where there had been a landslip, at least
forty yards away. And the murderer, in a few
minutes, had carried it all that distance and flung it
on his victim's head.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the murderer, who was most
certainly not hiding in the forest—for, if so, he must
inevitably have been discovered, the forest being
of limited extent—had the audacity, eight days
after the crime, to come back to the turn on the
hill and leave his goat-skin coat there. Why?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214" name="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
With what object? There was nothing in the pockets
of the coat, except a corkscrew and a napkin. What
did it all mean?</p>
<p>Inquiries were made of the builder of the motor-car,
who recognized the limousine as one which he
had sold, three years ago, to a Russian. The said
Russian, declared the manufacturer, had sold it
again at once. To whom? No one knew. The car
bore no number.</p>
<p>Then again, it was impossible to identify the dead
woman's body. Her clothes and underclothing
were not marked in any way. And the face was quite
unknown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, detectives were going along the national
road in the direction opposite to that taken by
the actors in this mysterious tragedy. But who was
to prove that the car had followed that particular
road on the previous night?</p>
<p>They examined every yard of the ground, they
questioned everybody. At last, they succeeded in
learning that, on the Saturday evening, a limousine
had stopped outside a grocer's shop in a small town
situated about two hundred miles from Saint-Nicolas,
on a highway branching out of the national road.
The driver had first filled his tank, bought some
spare cans of petrol and lastly taken away a small
stock of provisions: a ham, fruit, biscuits, wine and a
half-bottle of Three Star brandy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215" name="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a lady on the driver's seat. She did
not get down. The blinds of the limousine were
drawn. One of these blinds was seen to move several
times. The shopman was positive that there was
somebody inside.</p>
<p>Presuming the shopman's evidence to be correct,
then the problem became even more complicated,
for, so far, no clue had revealed the presence of a
third person.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the travellers had supplied themselves
with provisions, it remained to be discovered
what they had done with them and what had become
of the remains.</p>
<p>The detectives retraced their steps. It was not
until they came to the fork of the two roads, at a
spot eleven or twelve miles from Saint-Nicolas, that
they met a shepherd who, in answer to their questions,
directed them to a neighbouring field, hidden
from view behind the screen of bushes, where he
had seen an empty bottle and other things.</p>
<p>The detectives were convinced at the first examination.
The motor-car had stopped there; and
the unknown travellers, probably after a night's
rest in their car, had breakfasted and resumed their
journey in the course of the morning.</p>
<p>One unmistakable proof was the half-bottle of
Three Star brandy sold by the grocer. This bottle
had its neck broken clean off with a stone. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216" name="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
stone employed for the purpose was picked up, as
was the neck of the bottle, with its cork, covered
with a tin-foil seal. The seal showed marks of
attempts that had been made to uncork the bottle
in the ordinary manner.</p>
<p>The detectives continued their search and followed
a ditch that ran along the field at right angles to the
road. It ended in a little spring, hidden under
brambles, which seemed to emit an offensive smell.
On lifting the brambles, they perceived a corpse,
the corpse of a man whose head had been smashed
in, so that it formed little more than a sort of pulp,
swarming with vermin. The body was dressed in
jacket and trousers of dark-brown leather. The
pockets were empty: no papers, no pocket-book,
no watch.</p>
<p>The grocer and his shopman were summoned and,
two days later, formally identified, by his dress and
figure, the traveller who had bought the petrol and
provisions on the Saturday evening.</p>
<p>The whole case, therefore, had to be reopened on
a fresh basis. The authorities were confronted with
a tragedy no longer enacted by two persons, a man
and a woman, of whom one had killed the other, but
by three persons, including two victims, of whom one
was the very man who was accused of killing his
companion.</p>
<p>As to the murderer, there was no doubt: he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217" name="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the person who travelled inside the motor-car and
who took the precaution to remain concealed behind
the curtains. He had first got rid of the driver and
rifled his pockets and then, after wounding the
woman, carried her off in a mad dash for death.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>Given a fresh case, unexpected discoveries,
unforeseen evidence, one might have hoped that
the mystery would be cleared up, or, at least, that
the inquiry would point a few steps along the road
to the truth. But not at all. The corpse was
simply placed beside the first corpse. New problems
were added to the old. The accusation of
murder was shifted from the one to the other. And
there it ended. Outside those tangible, obvious
facts there was nothing but darkness. The name
of the woman, the name of the man, the name of
the murderer were so many riddles. And then
what had become of the murderer? If he had
disappeared from one moment to the other,
that in itself would have been a tolerably curious
phenomenon. But the phenomenon was actually
something very like a miracle, inasmuch as the
murderer had not absolutely disappeared. He was
there! He made a practice of returning to the
scene of the catastrophe! In addition to the goat-skin
coat, a fur cap was picked up one day; and,
by way of an unparalleled prodigy, one morning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218" name="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
after a whole night spent on guard in the rock, beside
the famous turning, the detectives found, on the
grass of the turning itself, a pair of motor-goggles,
broken, rusty, dirty, done for. How had the murderer
managed to bring back those goggles unseen
by the detectives? And, above all, why had he
brought them back?</p>
<p>Men's brains reeled in the presence of such abnormalities.
They were almost afraid to pursue
the ambiguous adventure. They received the impression
of a heavy, stifling, breathless atmosphere,
which dimmed the eyes and baffled the most clear-sighted.</p>
<p>The magistrate in charge of the case fell ill. Four
days later, his successor confessed that the matter
was beyond him.</p>
<p>Two tramps were arrested and at once released.
Another was pursued, but not caught; moreover,
there was no evidence of any sort or kind against
him. In short, it was nothing but one helpless
muddle of mist and contradiction.</p>
<p>An accident, the merest accident led to the
solution, or rather produced a series of circumstances
that ended by leading to the solution. A
reporter on the staff of an important Paris paper,
who had been sent to make investigations on
the spot, concluded his article with the following
words:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219" name="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>"I repeat, therefore, that we must wait for fresh
events, fresh facts; we must wait for some lucky
accident. As things stand, we are simply wasting
our time. The elements of truth are not even sufficient
to suggest a plausible theory. We are in
the midst of the most absolute, painful, impenetrable
darkness. There is nothing to be done. All
the Sherlock Holmeses in the world would not know
what to make of the mystery, and Arsène Lupin
himself, if he will allow me to say so, would have to
pay forfeit here."</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>On the day after the appearance of that article,
the newspaper in question printed this telegram:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Have sometimes paid forfeit, but never over such
a silly thing as this. The Saint-Nicolas tragedy is a
mystery for babies.</p>
<p style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 40em;">"Arsène Lupin."</p></div>
<p>And the editor added:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"We insert this telegram as a matter of curiosity,
for it is obviously the work of a wag. Arsène Lupin,
past-master though he be in the art of practical
joking, would be the last man to display such childish
flippancy."</p></div>
<p>Two days elapsed; and then the paper published
the famous letter, so precise and categorical in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220" name="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
conclusions, in which Arsène Lupin furnished the
solution of the problem. I quote it in full:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:
</p>
<p>"You have taken me on my weak side by defying
me. You challenge me, and I accept the
challenge. And I will begin by declaring once more
that the Saint-Nicolas tragedy is a mystery for
babies. I know nothing so simple, so natural; and
the proof of the simplicity shall lie in the succinctness
of my demonstration. It is contained in these
few words: when a crime seems to go beyond the
ordinary scope of things, when it seems unusual and
stupid, then there are many chances that its explanation
is to be found in superordinary, supernatural,
superhuman motives.</p>
<p>"I say that there are many chances, for we must
always allow for the part played by absurdity in the
most logical and commonplace events. But, of
course, it is impossible to see things as they are and
not to take account of the absurd and the disproportionate.</p>
<p>"I was struck from the very beginning by that
very evident character of unusualness. We have,
first of all, the awkward, zigzag course of the motor-car,
which would give one the impression that the
car was driven by a novice. People have spoken
of a drunkard or a madman, a justifiable supposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221" name="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in itself. But neither madness nor drunkenness
would account for the incredible strength required
to transport, especially in so short a space of
time, the stone with which the unfortunate woman's
head was crushed. That proceeding called for a
muscular power so great that I do not hesitate to
look upon it as a second sign of the unusualness
that marks the whole tragedy. And why move
that enormous stone, to finish off the victim,
when a mere pebble would have done the work?
Why again was the murderer not killed, or at least
reduced to a temporary state of helplessness,
in the terrible somersault turned by the car? How
did he disappear? And why, having disappeared,
did he return to the scene of the accident?
Why did he throw his fur coat there; then, on another
day, his cap; then, on another day, his goggles?</p>
<p>"Unusual, useless, stupid acts.</p>
<p>"Why, besides, convey that wounded, dying
woman on the driver's seat of the car, where everybody
could see her? Why do that, instead of
putting her inside, or flinging her into some corner,
dead, just as the man was flung under the brambles
in the ditch?</p>
<p>"Unusualness, stupidity.</p>
<p>"Everything in the whole story is absurd.
Everything points to hesitation, incoherency, awk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222" name="Page_222">[222]</a></span>wardness,
the silliness of a child or rather of a mad,
blundering savage, of a brute.</p>
<p>"Look at the bottle of brandy. There was a
corkscrew: it was found in the pocket of the great
coat. Did the murderer use it? Yes, the marks
of the corkscrew can be seen on the seal. But
the operation was too complicated for him.
He broke the neck with a stone. Always stones:
observe that detail. They are the only weapon,
the only implement which the creature employs.
It is his customary weapon, his familiar implement.
He kills the man with a stone, he kills
the woman with a stone and he opens bottles with a
stone!</p>
<p>"A brute, I repeat, a savage; disordered, unhinged,
suddenly driven mad. By what? Why,
of course, by that same brandy, which he swallowed
at a draught while the driver and his companion
were having breakfast in the field. He got out of
the limousine, in which he was travelling, in his
goat-skin coat and his fur cap, took the bottle, broke
off the neck and drank. There is the whole story.
Having drunk, he went raving mad and hit out at
random, without reason. Then, seized with instinctive
fear, dreading the inevitable punishment,
he hid the body of the man. Then, like an idiot,
he took up the wounded woman and ran away.
He ran away in that motor-car which he did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223" name="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
know how to work, but which to him represented
safety, escape from capture.</p>
<p>"But the money, you will ask, the stolen pocket-book?
Why, who says that he was the thief? Who
says that it was not some passing tramp, some labourer,
guided by the stench of the corpse?</p>
<p>"Very well, you object, but the brute would have
been found, as he is hiding somewhere near the turn,
and as, after all, he must eat and drink.</p>
<p>"Well, well, I see that you have not yet understood.
The simplest way, I suppose, to have done
and to answer your objections is to make straight
for the mark. Then let the gentlemen of the police
and the gendarmerie themselves make straight for
the mark. Let them take firearms. Let them explore
the forest within a radius of two or three
hundred yards from the turn, no more. But,
instead of exploring with their heads down and
their eyes fixed on the ground, let them look
up into the air, yes, into the air, among the
leaves and branches of the tallest oaks and the
most unlikely beeches. And, believe me, they
will see him. For he is there. He is there,
bewildered, piteously at a loss, seeking for the man
and woman whom he has killed, looking for them
and waiting for them and not daring to go away and
quite unable to understand.</p>
<p>"I myself am exceedingly sorry that I am kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224" name="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in town by urgent private affairs and by some
complicated matters of business which I have to set
going, for I should much have liked to see the end
of this rather curious adventure.</p>
<p>"Pray, therefore excuse me to my kind friends in
the police and permit me to be, sir,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 33em; margin-top: 1em;">"Your obedient servant,</p>
<p style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 38em; margin-top: .5em;">"Arsène Lupin."</p></div>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>The upshot will be remembered. The "gentlemen
of the police and the gendarmerie" shrugged
their shoulders and paid no attention to this lucubration.
But four of the local country gentry
took their rifles and went shooting, with their eyes
fixed skyward, as though they meant to pot a few
rooks. In half an hour they had caught sight of the
murderer. Two shots, and he came tumbling from
bough to bough. He was only wounded, and they
took him alive.</p>
<p>That evening, a Paris paper, which did not yet
know of the capture, printed the following paragraphs:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Enquiries are being made after a M. and Mme.
Bragoff, who landed at Marseilles six weeks ago and
there hired a motor-car. They had been living in
Australia for many years, during which time they
had not visited Europe; and they wrote to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225" name="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
director of the Jardin d'Acclimatation, with whom
they were in the habit of corresponding, that they
were bringing with them a curious creature, of an
entirely unknown species, of which it was difficult to
say whether it was a man or a monkey.</p>
<p>"According to M. Bragoff, who is an eminent
archæologist, the specimen in question is the anthropoid
ape, or rather the ape-man, the existence
of which had not hitherto been definitely proved.
The structure is said to be exactly similar to that of
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>, discovered by Dr. Dubois
in Java in 1891.</p>
<p>"This curious, intelligent and observant animal
acted as its owner's servant on their property in
Australia and used to clean their motor-car and even
attempt to drive it.</p>
<p>"The question that is being asked is where are
M. and Mme. Bragoff? Where is the strange primate
that landed with them at Marseilles?"</p></div>
<p>The answer to this question was now made easy.
Thanks to the hints supplied by Arsène Lupin, all
the elements of the tragedy were known. Thanks
to him, the culprit was in the hands of the law.</p>
<p>You can see him at the Jardin d'Acclimatation,
where he is locked up under the name of "Three
Stars." He is, in point of fact, a monkey; but he
is also a man. He has the gentleness and the wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226" name="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of the domestic animals and the sadness which they
feel when their master dies. But he has many other
qualities that bring him much closer to humanity:
he is treacherous, cruel, idle, greedy and quarrelsome;
and, above all, he is immoderately fond of
brandy.</p>
<p>Apart from that, he is a monkey. Unless indeed ...!</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>A few days after Three Stars' arrest, I saw Arsène
Lupin standing in front of his cage. Lupin was
manifestly trying to solve this interesting problem
for himself. I at once said, for I had set my heart
upon having the matter out with him:</p>
<p>"You know, Lupin, that intervention of yours,
your argument, your letter, in short, did not surprise
me so much as you might think!"</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" he said, calmly. "And why?"</p>
<p>"Why? Because the incident has occurred
before, seventy or eighty years ago. Edgar Allan
Poe made it the subject of one of his finest tales.
In those circumstances, the key to the riddle was
easy enough to find."</p>
<p>Arsène Lupin took my arm, and walking away
with me, said:</p>
<p>"When did you guess it, yourself?"</p>
<p>"On reading your letter," I confessed.</p>
<p>"And at what part of my letter?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227" name="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>"At the end."</p>
<p>"At the end, eh? After I had dotted all the
i's. So here is a crime which accident causes to be
repeated, under quite different conditions, it is
true, but still with the same sort of hero; and your
eyes had to be opened, as well as other people's. It
needed the assistance of my letter, the letter in
which I amused myself—apart from the exigencies
of the facts—by employing the argument and sometimes
the identical words used by the American
poet in a story which everybody has read. So you
see that my letter was not absolutely useless and that
one may safely venture to repeat to people things
which they have learnt only to forget them."</p>
<p>Wherewith Lupin turned on his heel and burst
out laughing in the face of an old monkey, who sat
with the air of a philosopher, gravely meditating.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">LUPIN'S MARRIAGE</h3>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-top: -.5em;"><p>"Monsieur Arsène Lupin has the honour to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228" name="Page_228">[228]</a></span>

with Monsieur Arsène Lupin, and to request...."</p></div>
<p>Jean Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme could not finish
reading the invitations which he held in his trembling
hand. Pale with anger, his long, lean body
shaking with tremors:</p>
<p>"There!" he gasped, handing the two communications
to his daughter. "This is what our friends
have received! This has been the talk of Paris
since yesterday! What do you say to that dastardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229" name="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
insult, Angélique? What would your poor mother
say to it, if she were alive?"</p>
<p>Angélique was tall and thin like her father, skinny
and angular like him. She was thirty-three years
of age, always dressed in black stuff, shy and retiring
in manner, with a head too small in proportion
to her height and narrowed on either side
until the nose seemed to jut forth in protest
against such parsimony. And yet it would be
impossible to say that she was ugly, for her eyes
were extremely beautiful, soft and grave, proud and
a little sad: pathetic eyes which to see once was
to remember.</p>
<p>She flushed with shame at hearing her father's
words, which told her the scandal of which she
was the victim. But, as she loved him, notwithstanding
his harshness to her, his injustice and
despotism, she said:</p>
<p>"Oh, I think it must be meant for a joke, father,
to which we need pay no attention!"</p>
<p>"A joke? Why, every one is gossiping about it!
A dozen papers have printed the confounded notice
this morning, with satirical comments. They quote
our pedigree, our ancestors, our illustrious dead.
They pretend to take the thing seriously...."</p>
<p>"Still, no one could believe...."</p>
<p>"Of course not. But that doesn't prevent us
from being the by-word of Paris."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230" name="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p>"It will all be forgotten by to-morrow."</p>
<p>"To-morrow, my girl, people will remember that
the name of Angélique de Sarzeau-Vendôme has
been bandied about as it should not be. Oh, if
I could find out the name of the scoundrel who has
dared...."</p>
<p>At that moment, Hyacinthe, the duke's valet,
came in and said that monsieur le duc was wanted
on the telephone. Still fuming, he took down the
receiver and growled:</p>
<p>"Well? Who is it? Yes, it's the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme
speaking."</p>
<p>A voice replied:</p>
<p>"I want to apologize to you, monsieur le duc,
and to Mlle. Angélique. It's my secretary's fault."</p>
<p>"Your secretary?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the invitations were only a rough draft
which I meant to submit to you. Unfortunately
my secretary thought...."</p>
<p>"But, tell me, monsieur, who are you?"</p>
<p>"What, monsieur le duc, don't you know my
voice? The voice of your future son-in-law?"</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Arsène Lupin."</p>
<p>The duke dropped into a chair. His face was
livid.</p>
<p>"Arsène Lupin ... it's he ... Arsène

<p>Angélique gave a smile:</p>
<p>"You see, father, it's only a joke, a hoax."</p>
<p>But the duke's rage broke out afresh and he
began to walk up and down, moving his arms:</p>
<p>"I shall go to the police!... The fellow can't
be allowed to make a fool of me in this way!...
If there's any law left in the land, it must be
stopped!"</p>
<p>Hyacinthe entered the room again. He brought
two visiting-cards.</p>
<p>"Chotois? Lepetit? Don't know them."</p>
<p>"They are both journalists, monsieur le duc."</p>
<p>"What do they want?"</p>
<p>"They would like to speak to monsieur le duc
with regard to ... the marriage...."</p>
<p>"Turn them out!" exclaimed the duke. "Kick
them out! And tell the porter not to admit scum
of that sort to my house in future."</p>
<p>"Please, father ..." Angélique ventured to say.</p>
<p>"As for you, shut up! If you had consented to
marry one of your cousins when I wanted you to
this wouldn't have happened."</p>
<p>The same evening, one of the two reporters printed,
on the front page of his paper, a somewhat fanciful
story of his expedition to the family mansion
of the Sarzeau-Vendômes, in the Rue de Varennes,
and expatiated pleasantly upon the old nobleman's
wrathful protests.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232" name="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p>The next morning, another newspaper published
an interview with Arsène Lupin which was supposed
to have taken place in a lobby at the Opera. Arsène
Lupin retorted in a letter to the editor:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"I share my prospective father-in-law's indignation
to the full. The sending out of the invitations
was a gross breach of etiquette for which I am not
responsible, but for which I wish to make a public
apology. Why, sir, the date of the marriage is not
yet fixed. My bride's father suggests early in May.
She and I think that six weeks is really too long
to wait!..."</p></div>
<p>That which gave a special piquancy to the affair
and added immensely to the enjoyment of the friends
of the family was the duke's well-known character:
his pride and the uncompromising nature of his
ideas and principles. Duc Jean was the last descendant
of the Barons de Sarzeau, the most ancient
family in Brittany; he was the lineal descendant of
that Sarzeau who, upon marrying a Vendôme, refused
to bear the new title which Louis XV forced
upon him until after he had been imprisoned for ten
years in the Bastille; and he had abandoned none
of the prejudices of the old régime. In his youth,
he followed the Comte de Chambord into exile.
In his old age, he refused a seat in the Chamber on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233" name="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the pretext that a Sarzeau could only sit with his
peers.</p>
<p>The incident stung him to the quick. Nothing
could pacify him. He cursed Lupin in good round
terms, threatened him with every sort of punishment
and rounded on his daughter:</p>
<p>"There, if you had only married!... After all
you had plenty of chances. Your three cousins,
Mussy, d'Emboise and Caorches, are noblemen of
good descent, allied to the best families, fairly well-off;
and they are still anxious to marry you. Why
do you refuse them? Ah, because miss is a dreamer,
a sentimentalist; and because her cousins are too
fat, or too thin, or too coarse for her...."</p>
<p>She was, in fact, a dreamer. Left to her own
devices from childhood, she had read all the books
of chivalry, all the colourless romances of olden-time
that littered the ancestral presses; and she
looked upon life as a fairy-tale in which the beauteous
maidens are always happy, while the others
wait till death for the bridegroom who does not come.
Why should she marry one of her cousins when they
were only after her money, the millions which she
had inherited from her mother? She might as well
remain an old maid and go on dreaming....</p>
<p>She answered, gently:</p>
<p>"You will end by making yourself ill, father.
Forget this silly business."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234" name="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>But how could he forget it? Every morning,
some pin-prick renewed his wound. Three days
running, Angélique received a wonderful sheaf of
flowers, with Arsène Lupin's card peeping from it.
The duke could not go to his club but a friend
accosted him:</p>
<p>"That was a good one to-day!"</p>
<p>"What was?"</p>
<p>"Why, your son-in-law's latest! Haven't you
seen it? Here, read it for yourself: 'M. Arsène
Lupin is petitioning the Council of State for permission
to add his wife's name to his own and to be
known henceforth as Lupin de Sarzeau-Vendôme.'"</p>
<p>And, the next day, he read:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"As the young bride, by virtue of an unrepealed
decree of Charles X, bears the title and arms of
the Bourbon-Condés, of whom she is the heiress-of-line,
the eldest son of the Lupins de Sarzeau-Vendôme
will be styled Prince de Bourbon-Condé."</p></div>
<p>And, the day after, an advertisement.</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Exhibition of Mlle. de Sarzeau-Vendôme's trousseau
at Messrs. ——'s Great Linen Warehouse.
Each article marked with initials L. S. V."</p></div>
<p>Then an illustrated paper published a photographic
scene: the duke, his daughter and his son-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235" name="Page_235">[235]</a></span>in-law
sitting at a table playing three-handed
auction-bridge.</p>
<p>And the date also was announced with a great
flourish of trumpets: the 4th of May.</p>
<p>And particulars were given of the marriage-settlement.
Lupin showed himself wonderfully disinterested.
He was prepared to sign, the newspapers
said, with his eyes closed, without knowing
the figure of the dowry.</p>
<p>All these things drove the old duke crazy. His
hatred of Lupin assumed morbid proportions. Much
as it went against the grain, he called on the prefect
of police, who advised him to be on his
guard:</p>
<p>"We know the gentleman's ways; he is employing
one of his favourite dodges. Forgive the expression,
monsieur le duc, but he is 'nursing' you. Don't
fall into the trap."</p>
<p>"What dodge? What trap?" asked the duke,
anxiously.</p>
<p>"He is trying to make you lose your head and to
lead you, by intimidation, to do something which
you would refuse to do in cold blood."</p>
<p>"Still, M. Arsène Lupin can hardly hope that I
will offer him my daughter's hand!"</p>
<p>"No, but he hopes that you will commit, to put
it mildly, a blunder."</p>
<p>"What blunder?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236" name="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<p>"Exactly that blunder which he wants you to
commit."</p>
<p>"Then you think, monsieur le préfet ...?"</p>
<p>"I think the best thing you can do, monsieur le
duc, is to go home, or, if all this excitement worries
you, to run down to the country and stay there
quietly, without upsetting yourself."</p>
<p>This conversation only increased the old duke's
fears. Lupin appeared to him in the light of a
terrible person, who employed diabolical methods
and kept accomplices in every sphere of society.
Prudence was the watchword.</p>
<p>And life, from that moment, became intolerable.
The duke grew more crabbed and silent than ever
and denied his door to all his old friends and even to
Angélique's three suitors, her Cousins de Mussy,
d'Emboise and de Caorches, who were none of them
on speaking terms with the others, in consequence
of their rivalry, and who were in the habit of calling,
turn and turn about, every week.</p>
<p>For no earthly reason, he dismissed his butler and
his coachman. But he dared not fill their places,
for fear of engaging creatures of Arsène Lupin's;
and his own man, Hyacinthe, in whom he had
every confidence, having had him in his service
for over forty years, had to take upon himself the
laborious duties of the stables and the pantry.</p>
<p>"Come, father," said Angélique, trying to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237" name="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
him listen to common-sense. "I really can't see
what you are afraid of. No one can force me into
this ridiculous marriage."</p>
<p>"Well, of course, that's not what I'm afraid of."</p>
<p>"What then, father?"</p>
<p>"How can I tell? An abduction! A burglary!
An act of violence! There is no doubt that the
villain is scheming something; and there is also
no doubt that we are surrounded by spies."</p>
<p>One afternoon, he received a newspaper in which
the following paragraph was marked in red pencil:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"The signing of the marriage-contract is fixed
for this evening, at the Sarzeau-Vendôme town-house.
It will be quite a private ceremony and
only a few privileged friends will be present to
congratulate the happy pair. The witnesses to
the contract on behalf of Mlle. de Sarzeau-Vendôme,
the Prince de la Rochefoucauld-Limours and the
Comte de Chartres, will be introduced by M. Arsène
Lupin to the two gentlemen who have claimed the
honour of acting as his groomsmen, namely, the
prefect of police and the governor of the Santé
Prison."</p></div>
<p>Ten minutes later, the duke sent his servant
Hyacinthe to the post with three express messages.
At four o'clock, in Angélique's presence, he saw the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238" name="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
three cousins: Mussy, fat, heavy, pasty-faced; d'Emboise,
slender, fresh-coloured and shy: Caorches,
short, thin and unhealthy-looking: all three, old
bachelors by this time, lacking distinction in dress
or appearance.</p>
<p>The meeting was a short one. The duke had
worked out his whole plan of campaign, a defensive
campaign, of which he set forth the first stage in
explicit terms:</p>
<p>"Angélique and I will leave Paris to-night for
our place in Brittany. I rely on you, my three
nephews, to help us get away. You, d'Emboise,
will come and fetch us in your car, with the hood up.
You, Mussy, will bring your big motor and kindly
see to the luggage with Hyacinthe, my man. You,
Caorches, will go to the Gare d'Orléans and book
our berths in the sleeping-car for Vannes by the
10.40 train. Is that settled?"</p>
<p>The rest of the day passed without incident.
The duke, to avoid any accidental indiscretion,
waited until after dinner to tell Hyacinthe to pack
a trunk and a portmanteau. Hyacinthe was to
accompany them, as well as Angélique's maid.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, all the other servants went to bed,
by their master's order. At ten minutes to ten,
the duke, who was completing his preparations,
heard the sound of a motor-horn. The porter
opened the gates of the courtyard. The duke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239" name="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
standing at the window, recognized d'Emboise's landaulette:</p>
<p>"Tell him I shall be down presently," he said to
Hyacinthe, "and let mademoiselle know."</p>
<p>In a few minutes, as Hyacinthe did not return,
he left his room. But he was attacked on the landing
by two masked men, who gagged and bound him
before he could utter a cry. And one of the men
said to him, in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Take this as a first warning, monsieur le duc.
If you persist in leaving Paris and refusing your
consent, it will be a more serious matter."</p>
<p>And the same man said to his companion:</p>
<p>"Keep an eye on him. I will see to the young
lady."</p>
<p>By that time, two other confederates had secured
the lady's maid; and Angélique, herself gagged, lay
fainting on a couch in her boudoir.</p>
<p>She came to almost immediately, under the
stimulus of a bottle of salts held to her nostrils;
and, when she opened her eyes, she saw bending
over her a young man, in evening-clothes, with a
smiling and friendly face, who said:</p>
<p>"I implore your forgiveness, mademoiselle. All
these happenings are a trifle sudden and this behaviour
rather out of the way. But circumstances
often compel us to deeds of which our conscience
does not approve. Pray pardon me."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240" name="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>He took her hand very gently and slipped a broad
gold ring on the girl's finger, saying:</p>
<p>"There, now we are engaged. Never forget
the man who gave you this ring. He entreats you
not to run away from him ... and to stay in
Paris and await the proofs of his devotion. Have
faith in him."</p>
<p>He said all this in so serious and respectful a
voice, with so much authority and deference, that
she had not the strength to resist. Their eyes met.
He whispered:</p>
<p>"The exquisite purity of your eyes! It would
be heavenly to live with those eyes upon one. Now
close them...."</p>
<p>He withdrew. His accomplices followed suit.
The car drove off, and the house in the Rue de
Varennes remained still and silent until the moment
when Angélique, regaining complete consciousness,
called out for the servants.</p>
<p>They found the duke, Hyacinthe, the lady's maid
and the porter and his wife all tightly bound. A few
priceless ornaments had disappeared, as well as
the duke's pocket-book and all his jewellery; tie
pins, pearl studs, watch and so on.</p>
<p>The police were advised without delay. In the
morning it appeared that, on the evening before,
d'Emboise, when leaving his house in the motor-car,
was stabbed by his own chauffeur and thrown,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241" name="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
half-dead, into a deserted street. Mussy and
Caorches had each received a telephone-message,
purporting to come from the duke, countermanding
their attendance.</p>
<p>Next week, without troubling further about the
police investigation, without obeying the summons
of the examining-magistrate, without even reading
Arsène Lupin's letters to the papers on "the Varennes
Flight," the duke, his daughter and his
valet stealthily took a slow train for Vannes and
arrived one evening, at the old feudal castle that
towers over the headland of Sarzeau. The duke at
once organized a defence with the aid of the Breton
peasants, true mediæval vassals to a man. On the
fourth day, Mussy arrived; on the fifth, Caorches;
and, on the seventh, d'Emboise, whose wound was
not as severe as had been feared.</p>
<p>The duke waited two days longer before communicating
to those about him what, now that
his escape had succeeded in spite of Lupin, he called
the second part of his plan. He did so, in the
presence of the three cousins, by a dictatorial order
to Angélique, expressed in these peremptory terms:</p>
<p>"All this bother is upsetting me terribly. I have
entered on a struggle with this man whose daring
you have seen for yourself; and the struggle is killing
me. I want to end it at all costs. There is
only one way of doing so, Angélique, and that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242" name="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
for you to release me from all responsibility by
accepting the hand of one of your cousins. Before
a month is out, you must be the wife of Mussy,
Caorches or d'Emboise. You have a free choice.
Make your decision."</p>
<p>For four whole days Angélique wept and entreated
her father, but in vain. She felt that he would be
inflexible and that she must end by submitting to
his wishes. She accepted:</p>
<p>"Whichever you please, father. I love none of
them. So I may as well be unhappy with one as
with the other."</p>
<p>Thereupon a fresh discussion ensued, as the duke
wanted to compel her to make her own choice.
She stood firm. Reluctantly and for financial considerations,
he named d'Emboise.</p>
<p>The banns were published without delay.</p>
<p>From that moment, the watch in and around the
castle was increased twofold, all the more inasmuch
as Lupin's silence and the sudden cessation of the
campaign which he had been conducting in the press
could not but alarm the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme.
It was obvious that the enemy was getting ready to
strike and would endeavour to oppose the marriage
by one of his characteristic moves.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, nothing happened: nothing two days
before the ceremony, nothing on the day before,
nothing on the morning itself. The marriage took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243" name="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
place in the mayor's office, followed by the religious
celebration in church; and the thing was done.</p>
<p>Then and not till then, the duke breathed freely.
Notwithstanding his daughter's sadness, notwithstanding
the embarrassed silence of his son-in-law,
who found the situation a little trying, he rubbed his
hands with an air of pleasure, as though he had
achieved a brilliant victory:</p>
<p>"Tell them to lower the drawbridge," he said
to Hyacinthe, "and to admit everybody. We have
nothing more to fear from that scoundrel."</p>
<p>After the wedding-breakfast, he had wine served
out to the peasants and clinked glasses with them.
They danced and sang.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, he returned to the ground-floor
rooms. It was the hour for his afternoon nap.
He walked to the guard-room at the end of the suite.
But he had no sooner placed his foot on the threshold
than he stopped suddenly and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, d'Emboise? Is this
a joke?"</p>
<p>D'Emboise was standing before him, dressed as a
Breton fisherman, in a dirty jacket and breeches,
torn, patched and many sizes too large for him.</p>
<p>The duke seemed dumbfounded. He stared with
eyes of amazement at that face which he knew and
which, at the same time, roused memories of a very
distant past within his brain. Then he strode<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244" name="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
abruptly to one of the windows overlooking the
castle-terrace and called:</p>
<p>"Angélique!"</p>
<p>"What is it, father?" she asked, coming forward.</p>
<p>"Where's your husband?"</p>
<p>"Over there, father," said Angélique, pointing
to d'Emboise, who was smoking a cigarette and
reading, some way off.</p>
<p>The duke stumbled and fell into a chair, with a
great shudder of fright:</p>
<p>"Oh, I shall go mad!"</p>
<p>But the man in the fisherman's garb knelt down
before him and said:</p>
<p>"Look at me, uncle. You know me, don't you?
I'm your nephew, the one who used to play here
in the old days, the one whom you called Jacquot....
Just think a minute.... Here, look at this
scar...."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," stammered the duke, "I recognize
you. It's Jacques. But the other one...."</p>
<p>He put his hands to his head:</p>
<p>"And yet, no, it can't be ... Explain yourself....
I don't understand.... I don't want to
understand...."</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which the newcomer
shut the window and closed the door leading to the
next room. Then he came up to the old duke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245" name="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
touched him gently on the shoulder, to wake him
from his torpor, and without further preface,
as though to cut short any explanation that was
not absolutely necessary, spoke as follows:</p>
<p>"Four years ago, that is to say, in the eleventh
year of my voluntary exile, when I settled in the
extreme south of Algeria, I made the acquaintance,
in the course of a hunting-expedition arranged by
a big Arab chief, of a man whose geniality, whose
charm of manner, whose consummate prowess, whose
indomitable pluck, whose combined humour and
depth of mind fascinated me in the highest degree.
The Comte d'Andrésy spent six weeks as my guest.
After he left, we kept up a correspondence at regular
intervals. I also often saw his name in the papers,
in the society and sporting columns. He was to
come back and I was preparing to receive him,
three months ago, when, one evening as I was out
riding, my two Arab attendants flung themselves
upon me, bound me, blindfolded me and took me,
travelling day and night, for a week, along deserted
roads, to a bay on the coast, where five men awaited
them. I was at once carried on board a small
steam-yacht, which weighed anchor without delay.
There was nothing to tell me who the men were nor
what their object was in kidnapping me. They
had locked me into a narrow cabin, secured by a
massive door and lighted by a port-hole protected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246" name="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
by two iron cross-bars. Every morning, a hand was
inserted through a hatch between the next cabin
and my own and placed on my bunk two or three
pounds of bread, a good helping of food and a
flagon of wine and removed the remains of yesterday's
meals, which I put there for the purpose.
From time to time, at night, the yacht stopped and I
heard the sound of the boat rowing to some harbour
and then returning, doubtless with provisions. Then
we set out once more, without hurrying, as though
on a cruise of people of our class, who travel for
pleasure and are not pressed for time. Sometimes,
standing on a chair, I would see the coastline,
through my port-hole, too indistinctly, however,
to locate it. And this lasted for weeks. One
morning, in the ninth week, I perceived that the
hatch had been left unfastened and I pushed it open.
The cabin was empty at the time. With an effort,
I was able to take a nail-file from a dressing-table.
Two weeks after that, by dint of patient perseverance,
I had succeeded in filing through the bars of
my port-hole and I could have escaped that way,
only, though I am a good swimmer, I soon grow
tired. I had therefore to choose a moment when the
yacht was not too far from the land. It was not
until yesterday that, perched on my chair, I caught
sight of the coast; and, in the evening, at sunset,
I recognized, to my astonishment, the outlines of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247" name="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Château de Sarzeau, with its pointed turrets and its
square keep. I wondered if this was the goal of
my mysterious voyage. All night long, we cruised
in the offing. The same all day yesterday. At
last, this morning, we put in at a distance which
I considered favourable, all the more so as we were
steaming through rocks under cover of which I could
swim unobserved. But, just as I was about to make
my escape, I noticed that the shutter of the hatch,
which they thought they had closed, had once more
opened of itself and was flapping against the partition.
I again pushed it ajar from curiosity. Within
arm's length was a little cupboard which I managed
to open and in which my hand, groping at random,
laid hold of a bundle of papers. This consisted of
letters, letters containing instructions addressed
to the pirates who held me prisoner. An hour later,
when I wriggled through the port-hole and slipped
into the sea, I knew all: the reasons for my abduction,
the means employed, the object in view and
the infamous scheme plotted during the last three
months against the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme and
his daughter. Unfortunately, it was too late. I
was obliged, in order not to be seen from the yacht,
to crouch in the cleft of a rock and did not reach
land until mid-day. By the time that I had been to
a fisherman's cabin, exchanged my clothes for his
and come on here, it was three o'clock. On my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248" name="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
arrival. I learnt that Angélique's marriage was celebrated
this morning."</p>
<p>The old duke had not spoken a word. With his
eyes riveted on the stranger's, he was listening in
ever-increasing dismay. At times, the thought of the
warnings given him by the prefect of police returned
to his mind:</p>
<p>"They're nursing you, monsieur le duc, they are
nursing you."</p>
<p>He said, in a hollow voice:</p>
<p>"Speak on ... finish your story.... All this
is ghastly.... I don't understand it yet ... and
I feel nervous...."</p>
<p>The stranger resumed:</p>
<p>"I am sorry to say, the story is easily pieced
together and is summed up in a few sentences.
It is like this: the Comte d'Andrésy remembered
several things from his stay with me and from the
confidences which I was foolish enough to make
to him. First of all, I was your nephew and yet
you had seen comparatively little of me, because
I left Sarzeau when I was quite a child, and since
then our intercourse was limited to the few weeks
which I spent here, fifteen years ago, when I proposed
for the hand of my Cousin Angélique;
secondly, having broken with the past, I received
no letters; lastly, there was a certain physical resemblance
between d'Andrésy and myself which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249" name="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
could be accentuated to such an extent as to become
striking. His scheme was built up on those three
points. He bribed my Arab servants to give
him warning in case I left Algeria. Then he went
back to Paris, bearing my name and made up to
look exactly like me, came to see you, was invited
to your house once a fortnight and lived under my
name, which thus became one of the many aliases
beneath which he conceals his real identity. Three
months ago, when 'the apple was ripe,' as he says
in his letters, he began the attack by a series of
communications to the press; and, at the same time,
fearing no doubt that some newspaper would tell
me in Algeria the part that was being played under
my name in Paris, he had me assaulted by my
servants and kidnapped by his confederates. I
need not explain any more in so far as you are concerned,
uncle."</p>
<p>The Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme was shaken with
a fit of nervous trembling. The awful truth to
which he refused to open his eyes appeared to him
in its nakedness and assumed the hateful countenance
of the enemy. He clutched his nephew's
hands and said to him, fiercely, despairingly:</p>
<p>"It's Lupin, is it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, uncle."</p>
<p>"And it's to him ... it's to him that I have
given my daughter!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250" name="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, uncle, to him, who has stolen my name
of Jacques d'Emboise from me and stolen your
daughter from you. Angélique is the wedded
wife of Arsène Lupin; and that in accordance
with your orders. This letter in his handwriting
bears witness to it. He has upset your whole life,
thrown you off your balance, besieging your hours
of waking and your nights of dreaming, rifling
your town-house, until the moment when, seized
with terror, you took refuge here, where, thinking
that you would escape his artifices and his rapacity,
you told your daughter to choose one of her
three cousins, Mussy, d'Emboise or Caorches, as
her husband.</p>
<p>"But why did she select that one rather than the
others?"</p>
<p>"It was you who selected him, uncle."</p>
<p>"At random ... because he had the biggest
income...."</p>
<p>"No, not at random, but on the insidious, persistent
and very clever advice of your servant
Hyacinthe."</p>
<p>The duke gave a start:</p>
<p>"What! Is Hyacinthe an accomplice?"</p>
<p>"No, not of Arsène Lupin, but of the man whom
he believes to be d'Emboise and who promised to
give him a hundred thousand francs within a week
after the marriage."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251" name="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, the villain!... He planned everything,
foresaw everything...."</p>
<p>"Foresaw everything, uncle, down to shamming
an attempt upon his life so as to avert suspicion,
down to shamming a wound received in your service."</p>
<p>"But with what object? Why all these dastardly
tricks?"</p>
<p>"Angélique has a fortune of eleven million francs.
Your solicitor in Paris was to hand the securities
next week to the counterfeit d'Emboise, who had
only to realize them forthwith and disappear. But,
this very morning, you yourself were to hand
your son-in-law, as a personal wedding-present,
five hundred thousand francs' worth of bearer-stock,
which he has arranged to deliver to one of
his accomplices at nine o'clock this evening,
outside the castle, near the Great Oak, so that
they may be negotiated to-morrow morning in
Brussels."</p>
<p>The Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme had risen from his
seat and was stamping furiously up and down the
room:</p>
<p>"At nine o'clock this evening?" he said. "We'll
see about that.... We'll see about that.... I'll
have the gendarmes here before then...."</p>
<p>"Arsène Lupin laughs at gendarmes."</p>
<p>"Let's telegraph to Paris."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252" name="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, but how about the five hundred thousand
francs?... And, still worse, uncle, the scandal?...
Think of this: your daughter, Angélique de
Sarzeau-Vendôme, married to that swindler, that
thief.... No, no, it would never do...."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"What?..."</p>
<p>The nephew now rose and, stepping to a gun-rack,
took down a rifle and laid it on the table, in
front of the duke:</p>
<p>"Away in Algeria, uncle, on the verge of the
desert, when we find ourselves face to face with a
wild beast, we do not send for the gendarmes. We
take our rifle and we shoot the wild beast. Otherwise,
the beast would tear us to pieces with its
claws."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that, over there, I acquired the habit
of dispensing with the gendarmes. It is a rather
summary way of doing justice, but it is the best
way, believe me, and to-day, in the present case,
it is the only way. Once the beast is killed, you
and I will bury it in some corner, unseen and unknown."</p>
<p>"And Angélique?"</p>
<p>"We will tell her later."</p>
<p>"What will become of her?"</p>
<p>"She will be my wife, the wife of the real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253" name="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
d'Emboise. I desert her to-morrow and return
to Algeria. The divorce will be granted in two
months' time."</p>
<p>The duke listened, pale and staring, with set
jaws. He whispered:</p>
<p>"Are you sure that his accomplices on the yacht
will not inform him of your escape?"</p>
<p>"Not before to-morrow."</p>
<p>"So that ...?"</p>
<p>"So that inevitably, at nine o'clock this evening,
Arsène Lupin, on his way to the Great Oak, will
take the patrol-path that follows the old ramparts
and skirts the ruins of the chapel. I shall be there,
in the ruins."</p>
<p>"I shall be there too," said the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme,
quietly, taking down a gun.</p>
<p>It was now five o'clock. The duke talked some
time longer to his nephew, examined the weapons,
loaded them with fresh cartridges. Then, when
night came, he took d'Emboise through the dark
passages to his bedroom and hid him in an adjoining
closet.</p>
<p>Nothing further happened until dinner. The duke
forced himself to keep calm during the meal. From
time to time, he stole a glance at his son-in-law and
was surprised at the likeness between him and the
real d'Emboise. It was the same complexion, the
same cast of features, the same cut of hair. Never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254" name="Page_254">[254]</a></span>theless,
the look of the eye was different, keener
in this case and brighter; and gradually the duke
discovered minor details which had passed unperceived
till then and which proved the fellow's imposture.</p>
<p>The party broke up after dinner. It was eight
o'clock. The duke went to his room and released
his nephew. Ten minutes later, under cover of
the darkness, they slipped into the ruins, gun in
hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Angélique, accompanied by her husband,
had gone to the suite of rooms which she
occupied on the ground-floor of a tower that flanked
the left wing. Her husband stopped at the entrance
to the rooms and said:</p>
<p>"I am going for a short stroll, Angélique. May
I come to you here, when I return?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>
<p>He left her and went up to the first floor, which
had been assigned to him as his quarters. The
moment he was alone, he locked the door, noiselessly
opened a window that looked over the
landscape and leant out. He saw a shadow at
the foot of the tower, some hundred feet or more
below him. He whistled and received a faint whistle
in reply.</p>
<p>He then took from a cupboard a thick leather
satchel, crammed with papers, wrapped it in a piece<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255" name="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of black cloth and tied it up. Then he sat down at
the table and wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Glad you got my message, for I think it unsafe
to walk out of the castle with that large bundle of
securities. Here they are. You will be in Paris,
on your motor-cycle, in time to catch the morning
train to Brussels, where you will hand over the bonds
to Z.; and he will negotiate them at once.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48em;">"A. L.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em;">"P. S.—As you pass by the Great Oak, tell our
chaps that I'm coming. I have some instructions
to give them. But everything is going well. No
one here has the least suspicion."</p></div>
<p>He fastened the letter to the parcel and lowered
both through the window with a length of string:</p>
<p>"Good," he said. "That's all right. It's a
weight off my mind."</p>
<p>He waited a few minutes longer, stalking up and
down the room and smiling at the portraits of two
gallant gentlemen hanging on the wall:</p>
<p>"Horace de Sarzeau-Vendôme, marshal of France....
And you, the Great Condé ... I salute you,
my ancestors both. Lupin de Sarzeau-Vendôme
will show himself worthy of you."</p>
<p>At last, when the time came, he took his hat and
went down. But, when he reached the ground-floor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256" name="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Angélique burst from her rooms and exclaimed, with
a distraught air:</p>
<p>"I say ... if you don't mind ... I think you
had better...."</p>
<p>And then, without saying more, she went in
again, leaving a vision of irresponsible terror in her
husband's mind.</p>
<p>"She's out of sorts," he said to himself. "Marriage
doesn't suit her."</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette and went out, without attaching
importance to an incident that ought to have impressed
him:</p>
<p>"Poor Angélique! This will all end in a divorce...."</p>
<p>The night outside was dark, with a cloudy sky.</p>
<p>The servants were closing the shutters of the
castle. There was no light in the windows, it
being the duke's habit to go to bed soon after
dinner.</p>
<p>Lupin passed the gate-keeper's lodge and, as he
put his foot on the drawbridge, said:</p>
<p>"Leave the gate open. I am going for a breath
of air; I shall be back soon."</p>
<p>The patrol-path was on the right and ran along
one of the old ramparts, which used to surround the
castle with a second and much larger enclosure,
until it ended at an almost demolished postern-gate.
The park, which skirted a hillock and afterward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257" name="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
followed the side of a deep valley, was bordered on
the left by thick coppices.</p>
<p>"What a wonderful place for an ambush!" he
said. "A regular cut-throat spot!"</p>
<p>He stopped, thinking that he heard a noise. But
no, it was a rustling of the leaves. And yet a stone
went rattling down the slopes, bounding against
the rugged projections of the rock. But, strange
to say, nothing seemed to disquiet him. The crisp
sea-breeze came blowing over the plains of the
headland; and he eagerly filled his lungs with it:</p>
<p>"What a thing it is to be alive!" he thought.
"Still young, a member of the old nobility, a multi-millionaire:
what could a man want more?"</p>
<p>At a short distance, he saw against the darkness
the yet darker outline of the chapel, the ruins of
which towered above the path. A few drops of
rain began to fall; and he heard a clock strike nine.
He quickened his pace. There was a short descent;
then the path rose again. And suddenly, he stopped
once more.</p>
<p>A hand had seized his.</p>
<p>He drew back, tried to release himself.</p>
<p>But some one stepped from the clump of trees
against which he was brushing; and a voice said;
"Ssh!... Not a word!..."</p>
<p>He recognized his wife, Angélique:</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258" name="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>She whispered, so low that he could hardly catch
the words:</p>
<p>"They are lying in wait for you ... they are in
there, in the ruins, with their guns...."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Keep quiet.... Listen...."</p>
<p>They stood for a moment without stirring; then
she said:</p>
<p>"They are not moving.... Perhaps they never
heard me.... Let's go back...."</p>
<p>"But...."</p>
<p>"Come with me."</p>
<p>Her accent was so imperious that he obeyed
without further question. But suddenly she took
fright:</p>
<p>"Run!... They are coming!... I am sure
of it!..."</p>
<p>True enough, they heard a sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>Then, swiftly, still holding him by the hand, she
dragged him, with irresistible energy, along a shortcut,
following its turns without hesitation in spite
of the darkness and the brambles. And they very
soon arrived at the drawbridge.</p>
<p>She put her arm in his. The gate-keeper touched
his cap. They crossed the courtyard and entered
the castle; and she led him to the corner tower
in which both of them had their apartments:</p>
<p>"Come in here," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259" name="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p>"To your rooms?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Two maids were sitting up for her. Their mistress
ordered them to retire to their bedrooms, on
the third floor.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after, there was a knock at
the door of the outer room; and a voice called:</p>
<p>"Angélique!"</p>
<p>"Is that you, father?" she asked, suppressing
her agitation.</p>
<p>"Yes. Is your husband here?"</p>
<p>"We have just come in."</p>
<p>"Tell him I want to speak to him. Ask him to
come to my room. It's important."</p>
<p>"Very well, father, I'll send him to you."</p>
<p>She listened for a few seconds, then returned to
the boudoir where her husband was and said:</p>
<p>"I am sure my father is still there."</p>
<p>He moved as though to go out:</p>
<p>"In that case, if he wants to speak to me...."</p>
<p>"My father is not alone," she said, quickly,
blocking his way.</p>
<p>"Who is with him?"</p>
<p>"His nephew, Jacques d'Emboise."</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence. He looked at her
with a certain astonishment, failing quite to understand
his wife's attitude. But, without pausing to
go into the matter:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260" name="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, so that dear old d'Emboise is there?" he
chuckled. "Then the fat's in the fire? Unless,
indeed...."</p>
<p>"My father knows everything," she said. "I
overheard a conversation between them just now.
His nephew has read certain letters.... I hesitated
at first about telling you.... Then I thought that
my duty...."</p>
<p>He studied her afresh. But, at once conquered
by the queerness of the situation, he burst out laughing:</p>
<p>"What? Don't my friends on board ship burn
my letters? And they have let their prisoner escape?
The idiots! Oh, when you don't see to everything
yourself!... No matter, its distinctly
humorous.... D'Emboise versus d'Emboise....
Oh, but suppose I were no longer recognized? Suppose
d'Emboise himself were to confuse me with
himself?"</p>
<p>He turned to a wash-hand-stand, took a towel,
dipped it in the basin and soaped it and, in the
twinkling of an eye, wiped the make-up from his
face and altered the set of his hair:</p>
<p>"That's it," he said, showing himself to Angélique
under the aspect in which she had seen him
on the night of the burglary in Paris. "I feel more
comfortable like this for a discussion with my father-in-law."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261" name="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>
<p>"Where are you going?" she cried, flinging herself
in front of the door.</p>
<p>"Why, to join the gentlemen."</p>
<p>"You shall not pass!"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Suppose they kill you?"</p>
<p>"Kill me?"</p>
<p>"That's what they mean to do, to kill you ...
to hide your body somewhere.... Who would
know of it?"</p>
<p>"Very well," he said, "from their point of view,
they are quite right. But, if I don't go to them,
they will come here. That door won't stop them....
Nor you, I'm thinking. Therefore, it's better
to have done with it."</p>
<p>"Follow me," commanded Angélique.</p>
<p>She took up the lamp that lit the room, went into
her bedroom, pushed aside the wardrobe, which
slid easily on hidden castors, pulled back an old
tapestry-hanging, and said:</p>
<p>"Here is a door that has not been used for years.
My father believes the key to be lost. I have it
here. Unlock the door with it. A staircase in the
wall will take you to the bottom of the tower. You
need only draw the bolts of another door and you
will be free."</p>
<p>He could hardly believe his ears. Suddenly, he
grasped the meaning of Angélique's whole behaviour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262" name="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
In front of that sad, plain, but wonderfully gentle
face, he stood for a moment discountenanced, almost
abashed. He no longer thought of laughing. A
feeling of respect, mingled with remorse and kindness,
overcame him.</p>
<p>"Why are you saving me?" he whispered.</p>
<p>"You are my husband."</p>
<p>He protested:</p>
<p>"No, no ... I have stolen that title. The law
will never recognize my marriage."</p>
<p>"My father does not want a scandal," she said.</p>
<p>"Just so," he replied, sharply, "just so. I foresaw
that; and that was why I had your cousin d'Emboise
near at hand. Once I disappear, he becomes
your husband. He is the man you have married
in the eyes of men."</p>
<p>"You are the man I have married in the eyes of
the Church."</p>
<p>"The Church! The Church! There are means
of arranging matters with the Church.... Your
marriage can be annulled."</p>
<p>"On what pretext that we can admit?"</p>
<p>He remained silent, thinking over all those points
which he had not considered, all those points which
were trivial and absurd for him, but which were
serious for her, and he repeated several times:</p>
<p>"This is terrible ... this is terrible.... I
should have anticipated...."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263" name="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>And, suddenly, seized with an idea, he clapped his
hands and cried:</p>
<p>"There, I have it! I'm hand in glove with one
of the chief figures at the Vatican. The Pope never
refuses me anything. I shall obtain an audience
and I have no doubt that the Holy Father, moved
by my entreaties...."</p>
<p>His plan was so humorous and his delight so
artless that Angélique could not help smiling; and
she said:</p>
<p>"I am your wife in the eyes of God."</p>
<p>She gave him a look that showed neither scorn
nor animosity, nor even anger; and he realized
that she omitted to see in him the outlaw and the
evil-doer and remembered only the man who was
her husband and to whom the priest had bound her
until the hour of death.</p>
<p>He took a step toward her and observed her more
attentively. She did not lower her eyes at first.
But she blushed. And never had he seen so pathetic
a face, marked with such modesty and such dignity.
He said to her, as on that first evening in Paris:</p>
<p>"Oh, your eyes ... the calm and sadness of
your eyes ... the beauty of your eyes!"</p>
<p>She dropped her head and stammered:</p>
<p>"Go away ... go ..."</p>
<p>In the presence of her confusion, he received a
quick intuition of the deeper feelings that stirred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264" name="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
her, unknown to herself. To that spinster soul, of
which he recognized the romantic power of imagination,
the unsatisfied yearnings, the poring over old-world
books, he suddenly represented, in that
exceptional moment and in consequence of the
unconventional circumstances of their meetings,
somebody special, a Byronic hero, a chivalrous
brigand of romance. One evening, in spite of all
obstacles, he, the world-famed adventurer, already
ennobled in song and story and exalted by his own
audacity, had come to her and slipped the magic
ring upon her finger: a mystic and passionate betrothal,
as in the days of the <i>Corsair</i> and <i>Hernani</i>....
Greatly moved and touched, he was on
the verge of giving way to an enthusiastic impulse
and exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Let us go away together!... Let us fly!...
You are my bride ... my wife.... Share my
dangers, my sorrows and my joys.... It will be
a strange and vigorous, a proud and magnificent
life...."</p>
<p>But Angélique's eyes were raised to his again;
and they were so pure and so noble that he blushed
in his turn. This was not the woman to whom such
words could be addressed.</p>
<p>He whispered:</p>
<p>"Forgive me.... I am a contemptible wretch....
I have wrecked your life...."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265" name="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>
<p>"No," she replied, softly. "On the contrary,
you have shown me where my real life lies."</p>
<p>He was about to ask her to explain. But she had
opened the door and was pointing the way to him.
Nothing more could be spoken between them. He
went out without a word, bowing very low as he
passed.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>A month later, Angélique de Sarzeau-Vendôme,
Princesse de Bourbon-Condé, lawful wife of Arsène
Lupin, took the veil and, under the name of Sister
Marie-Auguste, buried herself within the walls of
the Visitation Convent.</p>
<p>On the day of the ceremony, the mother superior
of the convent received a heavy sealed envelope
containing a letter with the following words:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"For Sister Marie-Auguste's poor."</p></div>
<p>Enclosed with the letter were five hundred bank-notes
of a thousand francs each.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="chapter"><a id="IX" name="IX"></a>IX</h2>
<h3 class="chapter2">THE INVISIBLE PRISONER</h3>
<p>One day, at about four o'clock, as evening was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266" name="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
drawing in, Farmer Goussot, with his four sons,
returned from a day's shooting. They were stalwart
men, all five of them, long of limb, broad-chested,
with faces tanned by sun and wind. And all five
displayed, planted on an enormous neck and
shoulders, the same small head with the low forehead,
thin lips, beaked nose and hard and repellent
cast of countenance. They were feared and disliked
by all around them. They were a money-grubbing,
crafty family; and their word was not to be trusted.</p>
<p>On reaching the old barbican-wall that surrounds
the Héberville property, the farmer opened a narrow,
massive door, putting the big key back in his pocket
after his sons had passed in. And he walked
behind them, along the path that led through the
orchards. Here and there stood great trees, stripped
by the autumn winds, and clumps of pines, the last
survivors of the ancient park now covered by old
Goussot's farm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267" name="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the sons said:</p>
<p>"I hope mother has lit a log or two."</p>
<p>"There's smoke coming from the chimney," said
the father.</p>
<p>The outhouses and the homestead showed at the
end of a lawn; and, above them, the village church,
whose steeple seemed to prick the clouds that trailed
along the sky.</p>
<p>"All the guns unloaded?" asked old Goussot.</p>
<p>"Mine isn't," said the eldest. "I slipped in a
bullet to blow a kestrel's head off...."</p>
<p>He was the one who was proudest of his skill. And
he said to his brothers:</p>
<p>"Look at that bough, at the top of the cherry
tree. See me snap it off."</p>
<p>On the bough sat a scarecrow, which had been
there since spring and which protected the leafless
branches with its idiot arms.</p>
<p>He raised his gun and fired.</p>
<p>The figure came tumbling down with large, comic
gestures, and was caught on a big, lower branch,
where it remained lying stiff on its stomach, with
a great top hat on its head of rags and its hay-stuffed
legs swaying from right to left above some water
that flowed past the cherry tree through a wooden
trough.</p>
<p>They all laughed. The father approved:</p>
<p>"A fine shot, my lad. Besides, the old boy was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268" name="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
beginning to annoy me. I couldn't take my eyes
from my plate at meals without catching sight of
that oaf...."</p>
<p>They went a few steps farther. They were not
more than thirty yards from the house, when the
father stopped suddenly and said:</p>
<p>"Hullo! What's up?"</p>
<p>The sons also had stopped and stood listening.
One of them said, under his breath:</p>
<p>"It comes from the house ... from the linen-room...."</p>
<p>And another spluttered:</p>
<p>"Sounds like moans.... And mother's alone!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a frightful scream rang out. All five
rushed forward. Another scream, followed by cries
of despair.</p>
<p>"We're here! We're coming!" shouted the eldest,
who was leading.</p>
<p>And, as it was a roundabout way to the door, he
smashed in a window with his fist and sprang into
the old people's bedroom. The room next to it was
the linen-room, in which Mother Goussot spent most
of her time.</p>
<p>"Damnation!" he said, seeing her lying on the
floor, with blood all over her face. "Dad! Dad!"</p>
<p>"What? Where is she?" roared old Goussot,
appearing on the scene. "Good lord, what's this?...
What have they done to your mother?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269" name="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p>She pulled herself together and, with outstretched
arm, stammered:</p>
<p>"Run after him!... This way!... This way!...
I'm all right ... only a scratch or two....
But run, you! He's taken the money."</p>
<p>The father and sons gave a bound:</p>
<p>"He's taken the money!" bellowed old Goussot,
rushing to the door to which his wife was pointing.
"He's taken the money! Stop thief!"</p>
<p>But a sound of several voices rose at the end of
the passage through which the other three sons were
coming:</p>
<p>"I saw him! I saw him!"</p>
<p>"So did I! He ran up the stairs."</p>
<p>"No, there he is, he's coming down again!"</p>
<p>A mad steeplechase shook every floor in the
house. Farmer Goussot, on reaching the end of
the passage, caught sight of a man standing by
the front door trying to open it. If he succeeded,
it meant safety, escape through the market square
and the back lanes of the village.</p>
<p>Interrupted as he was fumbling at the bolts, the
man turning stupid, lost his head, charged at old
Goussot and sent him spinning, dodged the eldest
brother and, pursued by the four sons, doubled back
down the long passage, ran into the old couple's
bedroom, flung his legs through the broken window
and disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270" name="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>The sons rushed after him across the lawns and
orchards, now darkened by the falling night.</p>
<p>"The villain's done for," chuckled old Goussot.
"There's no way out for him. The walls are too
high. He's done for, the scoundrel!"</p>
<p>The two farm-hands returned, at that moment,
from the village; and he told them what had happened
and gave each of them a gun:</p>
<p>"If the swine shows his nose anywhere near the
house," he said, "let fly at him. Give him no
mercy!"</p>
<p>He told them where to stand, went to make
sure that the farm-gates, which were only used
for the carts, were locked, and, not till then, remembered
that his wife might perhaps be in need
of aid:</p>
<p>"Well, mother, how goes it?"</p>
<p>"Where is he? Have you got him?" she asked,
in a breath.</p>
<p>"Yes, we're after him. The lads must have
collared him by now."</p>
<p>The news quite restored her; and a nip of rum
gave her the strength to drag herself to the bed, with
old Goussot's assistance, and to tell her story. For
that matter, there was not much to tell. She
had just lit the fire in the living-hall; and she was
knitting quietly at her bedroom window, waiting
for the men to return, when she thought that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271" name="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
heard a slight grating sound in the linen-room next
door:</p>
<p>"I must have left the cat in there," she thought
to herself.</p>
<p>She went in, suspecting nothing, and was astonished
to see the two doors of one of the linen-cupboards,
the one in which they hid their money,
wide open. She walked up to it, still without suspicion.
There was a man there, hiding, with his
back to the shelves.</p>
<p>"But how did he get in?" asked old Goussot.</p>
<p>"Through the passage, I suppose. We never keep
the back door shut."</p>
<p>"And then did he go for you?"</p>
<p>"No, I went for him. He tried to get away."</p>
<p>"You should have let him."</p>
<p>"And what about the money?"</p>
<p>"Had he taken it by then?"</p>
<p>"Had he taken it! I saw the bundle of bank-notes
in his hands, the sweep! I would have let
him kill me sooner.... Oh, we had a sharp tussle,
I give you my word!"</p>
<p>"Then he had no weapon?'</p>
<p>"No more than I did. We had our fingers, our
nails and our teeth. Look here, where he bit me.
And I yelled and screamed! Only, I'm an old
woman you see.... I had to let go of him...."</p>
<p>"Do you know the man?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272" name="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure it was old Trainard."</p>
<p>"The tramp? Why, of course it's old Trainard!"
cried the farmer. "I thought I knew him too....
Besides, he's been hanging round the house these
last three days. The old vagabond must have smelt
the money. Aha, Trainard, my man, we shall see
some fun! A number-one hiding in the first place;
and then the police.... I say, mother, you can
get up now, can't you? Then go and fetch the
neighbours.... Ask them to run for the gendarmes....
By the by, the attorney's youngster has
a bicycle.... How that damned old Trainard
scooted! He's got good legs for his age, he has.
He can run like a hare!"</p>
<p>Goussot was holding his sides, revelling in the
occurrence. He risked nothing by waiting. No
power on earth could help the tramp escape or keep
him from the sound thrashing which he had earned
and from being conveyed, under safe escort, to the
town gaol.</p>
<p>The farmer took a gun and went out to his two
labourers:</p>
<p>"Anything fresh?"</p>
<p>"No, Farmer Goussot, not yet."</p>
<p>"We sha'n't have long to wait. Unless old Nick
carries him over the walls...."</p>
<p>From time to time, they heard the four brothers
hailing one another in the distance. The old bird<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273" name="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was evidently making a fight for it, was more active
than they would have thought. Still, with sturdy
fellows like the Goussot brothers....</p>
<p>However, one of them returned, looking rather
crestfallen, and made no secret of his opinion:</p>
<p>"It's no use keeping on at it for the present.
It's pitch dark. The old chap must have crept into
some hole. We'll hunt him out to-morrow."</p>
<p>"To-morrow! Why, lad, you're off your
chump!" protested the farmer.</p>
<p>The eldest son now appeared, quite out of breath,
and was of the same opinion as his brother. Why
not wait till next day, seeing that the ruffian was
as safe within the demesne as between the walls
of a prison?</p>
<p>"Well, I'll go myself," cried old Goussot. "Light
me a lantern, somebody!"</p>
<p>But, at that moment, three gendarmes arrived;
and a number of village lads also came up to hear
the latest.</p>
<p>The sergeant of gendarmes was a man of method.
He first insisted on hearing the whole story, in full
detail; then he stopped to think; then he questioned
the four brothers, separately, and took his time for
reflection after each deposition. When he had
learnt from them that the tramp had fled toward
the back of the estate, that he had been lost sight
of repeatedly and that he had finally disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274" name="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
near a place known as the Crows' Knoll, he meditated
once more and announced his conclusion:</p>
<p>"Better wait. Old Trainard might slip through
our hands, amidst all the confusion of a pursuit
in the dark, and then good-night, everybody!"</p>
<p>The farmer shrugged his shoulders and, cursing
under his breath, yielded to the sergeant's arguments.
That worthy organized a strict watch,
distributed the brothers Goussot and the lads from
the village under his men's eyes, made sure that the
ladders were locked away and established his headquarters
in the dining-room, where he and Farmer
Goussot sat and nodded over a decanter of old
brandy.</p>
<p>The night passed quietly. Every two hours, the
sergeant went his rounds and inspected the posts.
There were no alarms. Old Trainard did not budge
from his hole.</p>
<p>The battle began at break of day.</p>
<p>It lasted four hours.</p>
<p>In those four hours, the thirteen acres of land
within the walls were searched, explored, gone over
in every direction by a score of men who beat the
bushes with sticks, trampled over the tall grass,
rummaged in the hollows of the trees and scattered
the heaps of dry leaves. And old Trainard remained
invisible.</p>
<p>"Well, this is a bit thick!" growled Goussot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275" name="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<p>"Beats me altogether," retorted the sergeant.</p>
<p>And indeed there was no explaining the phenomenon.
For, after all, apart from a few old clumps
of laurels and spindle-trees, which were thoroughly
beaten, all the trees were bare. There was no
building, no shed, no stack, nothing, in short, that
could serve as a hiding-place.</p>
<p>As for the wall, a careful inspection convinced
even the sergeant that it was physically impossible
to scale it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the investigations were begun
all over again in the presence of the examining-magistrate
and the public-prosecutor's deputy. The
results were no more successful. Nay, worse, the
officials looked upon the matter as so suspicious that
they could not restrain their ill-humour and asked:</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure, Farmer Goussot, that you
and your sons haven't been seeing double?"</p>
<p>"And what about my wife?" retorted the farmer,
red with anger. "Did she see double when the
scamp had her by the throat? Go and look at the
marks, if you doubt me!"</p>
<p>"Very well. But then where is the scamp?"</p>
<p>"Here, between those four walls."</p>
<p>"Very well. Then ferret him out. We give it
up. It's quite clear, that if a man were hidden
within the precincts of this farm, we should have
found him by now."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276" name="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
<p>"I swear I'll lay hands on him, true as I stand
here!" shouted Farmer Goussot. "It shall not
be said that I've been robbed of six thousand francs.
Yes, six thousand! There were three cows I sold;
and then the wheat-crop; and then the apples.
Six thousand-franc notes, which I was just going
to take to the bank. Well, I swear to Heaven that
the money's as good as in my pocket!"</p>
<p>"That's all right and I wish you luck," said
the examining-magistrate, as he went away, followed
by the deputy and the gendarmes.</p>
<p>The neighbours also walked off in a more or less
facetious mood. And, by the end of the afternoon,
none remained but the Goussots and the two farm-labourers.</p>
<p>Old Goussot at once explained his plan. By
day, they were to search. At night, they were to
keep an incessant watch. It would last as long as
it had to. Hang it, old Trainard was a man like
other men; and men have to eat and drink! Old
Trainard must needs, therefore, come out of his
earth to eat and drink.</p>
<p>"At most," said Goussot, "he can have a few
crusts of bread in his pocket, or even pull up a root
or two at night. But, as far as drink's concerned,
no go. There's only the spring. And he'll be a
clever dog if he gets near that."</p>
<p>He himself, that evening, took up his stand near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277" name="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the spring. Three hours later, his eldest son relieved
him. The other brothers and the farm-hands
slept in the house, each taking his turn of the watch
and keeping all the lamps and candles lit, so that
there might be no surprise.</p>
<p>So it went on for fourteen consecutive nights.
And for fourteen days, while two of the men and
Mother Goussot remained on guard, the five others
explored the Héberville ground.</p>
<p>At the end of that fortnight, not a sign.</p>
<p>The farmer never ceased storming. He sent for a
retired detective-inspector who lived in the neighbouring
town. The inspector stayed with him for a
whole week. He found neither old Trainard nor
the least clue that could give them any hope of
finding old Trainard.</p>
<p>"It's a bit thick!" repeated Farmer Goussot.
"For he's there, the rascal! As far as being anywhere
goes, he's there. So...."</p>
<p>Planting himself on the threshold, he railed at the
enemy at the top of his voice:</p>
<p>"You blithering idiot, would you rather croak
in your hole than fork out the money? Then
croak, you pig!"</p>
<p>And Mother Goussot, in her turn, yelped, in her
shrill voice:</p>
<p>"Is it prison you're afraid of? Hand over the
notes and you can hook it!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278" name="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>
<p>But old Trainard did not breathe a word; and
the husband and wife tired their lungs in vain.</p>
<p>Shocking days passed. Farmer Goussot could
no longer sleep, lay shivering with fever. The
sons became morose and quarrelsome and never
let their guns out of their hands, having no other
idea but to shoot the tramp.</p>
<p>It was the one topic of conversation in the village;
and the Goussot story, from being local at first,
soon went the round of the press. Newspaper-reporters
came from the assize-town, from Paris
itself, and were rudely shown the door by Farmer
Goussot.</p>
<p>"Each man his own house," he said. "You
mind your business. I mind mine. It's nothing
to do with any one."</p>
<p>"Still, Farmer Goussot...."</p>
<p>"Go to blazes!"</p>
<p>And he slammed the door in their face.</p>
<p>Old Trainard had now been hidden within the
walls of Héberville for something like four weeks.
The Goussots continued their search as doggedly
and confidently as ever, but with daily decreasing
hope, as though they were confronted with one of
those mysterious obstacles which discourage human
effort. And the idea that they would never see
their money again began to take root in them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279" name="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>One fine morning, at about ten o'clock, a motor-car,
crossing the village square at full speed, broke
down and came to a dead stop.</p>
<p>The driver, after a careful inspection, declared
that the repairs would take some little time, whereupon
the owner of the car resolved to wait at the
inn and lunch. He was a gentleman on the right
side of forty, with close-cropped side-whiskers and
a pleasant expression of face; and he soon made
himself at home with the people at the inn.</p>
<p>Of course, they told him the story of the Goussots.
He had not heard it before, as he had been abroad;
but it seemed to interest him greatly. He made
them give him all the details, raised objections,
discussed various theories with a number of people
who were eating at the same table and ended by
exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Nonsense! It can't be so intricate as all that.
I have had some experience of this sort of thing.
And, if I were on the premises...."</p>
<p>"That's easily arranged," said the inn-keeper.
"I know Farmer Goussot.... He won't object...."</p>
<p>The request was soon made and granted. Old
Goussot was in one of those frames of mind when
we are less disposed to protest against outside interference.
His wife, at any rate, was very firm:</p>
<p>"Let the gentleman come, if he wants to."</p>
<p>The gentleman paid his bill and instructed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280" name="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
driver to try the car on the high-road as soon as the
repairs were finished:</p>
<p>"I shall want an hour," he said, "no more. Be
ready in an hour's time."</p>
<p>Then he went to Farmer Goussot's.</p>
<p>He did not say much at the farm. Old Goussot,
hoping against hope, was lavish with information,
took his visitor along the walls down to the little
door opening on the fields, produced the key and
gave minute details of all the searches that had been
made so far.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the stranger, who hardly spoke,
seemed not to listen either. He merely looked, with
a rather vacant gaze. When they had been round
the estate, old Goussot asked, anxiously:</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well what?"</p>
<p>"Do you think you know?"</p>
<p>The visitor stood for a moment without answering.
Then he said:</p>
<p>"No, nothing."</p>
<p>"Why, of course not!" cried the farmer, throwing
up his arms. "How should you know! It's all
hanky-panky. Shall I tell you what I think?
Well, that old Trainard has been so jolly clever that
he's lying dead in his hole ... and the bank-notes
are rotting with him. Do you hear? You can
take my word for it."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281" name="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>
<p>The gentleman said, very calmly:</p>
<p>"There's only one thing that interests me. The
tramp, all said and done, was free at night and able
to feed on what he could pick up. But how about
drinking?"</p>
<p>"Out of the question!" shouted the farmer.
"Quite out of the question! There's no water except
this; and we have kept watch beside it every night."</p>
<p>"It's a spring. Where does it rise?"</p>
<p>"Here, where we stand."</p>
<p>"Is there enough pressure to bring it into the
pool of itself?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And where does the water go when it runs out
of the pool?"</p>
<p>"Into this pipe here, which goes under ground
and carries it to the house, for use in the kitchen.
So there's no way of drinking, seeing that we were
there and that the spring is twenty yards from the
house."</p>
<p>"Hasn't it rained during the last four weeks?"</p>
<p>"Not once: I've told you that already."</p>
<p>The stranger went to the spring and examined
it. The trough was formed of a few boards of
wood joined together just above the ground; and
the water ran through it, slow and clear.</p>
<p>"The water's not more than a foot deep, is it?"
he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282" name="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to measure it, he picked up from the
grass a straw which he dipped into the pool. But,
as he was stooping, he suddenly broke off and looked
around him.</p>
<p>"Oh, how funny!" he said, bursting into a peal
of laughter.</p>
<p>"Why, what's the matter?" spluttered old
Goussot, rushing toward the pool, as though a
man could have lain hidden between those narrow
boards.</p>
<p>And Mother Goussot clasped her hands.</p>
<p>"What is it? Have you seen him? Where is
he?"</p>
<p>"Neither in it nor under it," replied the stranger,
who was still laughing.</p>
<p>He made for the house, eagerly followed by the
farmer, the old woman and the four sons. The
inn-keeper was there also, as were the people from
the inn who had been watching the stranger's movements.
And there was a dead silence, while they
waited for the extraordinary disclosure.</p>
<p>"It's as I thought," he said, with an amused
expression. "The old chap had to quench his
thirst somewhere; and, as there was only the
spring...."</p>
<p>"Oh, but look here," growled Farmer Goussot,
"we should have seen him!"</p>
<p>"It was at night."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283" name="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>"We should have heard him ... and seen him
too, as we were close by."</p>
<p>"So was he."</p>
<p>"And he drank the water from the pool?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"From a little way off."</p>
<p>"With what?"</p>
<p>"With this."</p>
<p>And the stranger showed the straw which he had
picked up:</p>
<p>"There, here's the straw for the customer's long
drink. You will see, there's more of it than usual:
in fact, it is made of three straws stuck into one
another. That was the first thing I noticed: those
three straws fastened together. The proof is conclusive."</p>
<p>"But, hang it all, the proof of what?" cried
Farmer Goussot, irritably.</p>
<p>The stranger took a shotgun from the rack.</p>
<p>"Is it loaded?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the youngest of the brothers. "I use
it to kill the sparrows with, for fun. It's small shot."</p>
<p>"Capital! A peppering where it won't hurt him
will do the trick."</p>
<p>His face suddenly assumed a masterful look.
He gripped the farmer by the arm and rapped out,
in an imperious tone:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284" name="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<p>"Listen to me, Farmer Goussot. I'm not here
to do policeman's work; and I won't have the poor
beggar locked up at any price. Four weeks of
starvation and fright is good enough for anybody.
So you've got to swear to me, you and your sons,
that you'll let him off without hurting him."</p>
<p>"He must hand over the money!"</p>
<p>"Well, of course. Do you swear?"</p>
<p>"I swear."</p>
<p>The gentleman walked back to the door-sill, at
the entrance to the orchard. He took a quick aim,
pointing his gun a little in the air, in the direction
of the cherry tree which overhung the spring. He
fired. A hoarse cry rang from the tree; and the
scarecrow which had been straddling the main
branch for a month past came tumbling to the
ground, only to jump up at once and make off as
fast as its legs could carry it.</p>
<p>There was a moment's amazement, followed by
outcries. The sons darted in pursuit and were not
long in coming up with the runaway, hampered as
he was by his rags and weakened by privation.
But the stranger was already protecting him against
their wrath:</p>
<p>"Hands off there! This man belongs to me.
I won't have him touched.... I hope I haven't
stung you up too much, Trainard?"</p>
<p>Standing on his straw legs wrapped round with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285" name="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
strips of tattered cloth, with his arms and his
whole body clad in the same materials, his head
swathed in linen, tightly packed like a sausage,
the old chap still had the stiff appearance of a
lay-figure. And the whole effect was so ludicrous
and so unexpected that the onlookers screamed
with laughter.</p>
<p>The stranger unbound his head; and they saw a
veiled mask of tangled grey beard encroaching on
every side upon a skeleton face lit up by two eyes
burning with fever.</p>
<p>The laughter was louder than ever.</p>
<p>"The money! The six notes!" roared the
farmer.</p>
<p>The stranger kept him at a distance:</p>
<p>"One moment ... we'll give you that back,
sha'n't we, Trainard?"</p>
<p>And, taking his knife and cutting away the straw
and cloth, he jested, cheerily:</p>
<p>"You poor old beggar, what a guy you look!
But how on earth did you manage to pull off that
trick? You must be confoundedly clever, or else
you had the devil's own luck.... So, on the first
night, you used the breathing-time they left you
to rig yourself in these togs! Not a bad idea. Who
could ever suspect a scarecrow?... They were so
accustomed to seeing it stuck up in its tree! But,
poor old daddy, how uncomfortable you must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286" name="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
felt, lying flat up there on your stomach, with your
arms and legs dangling down! All day long, like
that! The deuce of an attitude! And how you
must have been put to it, when you ventured to
move a limb, eh? And how you must have funked
going to sleep!... And then you had to eat!
And drink! And you heard the sentry and felt
the barrel of his gun within a yard of your nose!
Brrrr!... But the trickiest of all, you know,
was your bit of straw!... Upon my word, when
I think that, without a sound, without a movement
so to speak, you had to fish out lengths of straw
from your toggery, fix them end to end, let your apparatus
down to the water and suck up the heavenly
moisture drop by drop.... Upon my word, one
could scream with admiration.... Well done, Trainard...."
And he added, between his teeth, "Only
you're in a very unappetizing state, my man.
Haven't you washed yourself all this month, you
old pig? After all, you had as much water as
you wanted!... Here, you people, I hand him
over to you. I'm going to wash my hands, that's
what I'm going to do."</p>
<p>Farmer Goussot and his four sons grabbed at
the prey which he was abandoning to them:</p>
<p>"Now then, come along, fork out the money."</p>
<p>Dazed as he was, the tramp still managed to
simulate astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287" name="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't put on that idiot look," growled the
farmer. "Come on. Out with the six notes...."</p>
<p>"What?... What do you want of me?" stammered
old Trainard.</p>
<p>"The money ... on the nail...."</p>
<p>"What money?"</p>
<p>"The bank-notes."</p>
<p>"The bank-notes?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm getting sick of you! Here, lads...."</p>
<p>They laid the old fellow flat, tore off the rags
that composed his clothes, felt and searched him
all over.</p>
<p>There was nothing on him.</p>
<p>"You thief and you robber!" yelled old Goussot.
"What have you done with it?"</p>
<p>The old beggar seemed more dazed than ever.
Too cunning to confess, he kept on whining:</p>
<p>"What do you want of me?... Money?
I haven't three sous to call my own...."</p>
<p>But his eyes, wide with wonder, remained fixed
upon his clothes; and he himself seemed not to understand.</p>
<p>The Goussots' rage could no longer be restrained.
They rained blows upon him, which did not improve
matters. But the farmer was convinced that Trainard
had hidden the money before turning himself
into the scarecrow:</p>
<p>"Where have you put it, you scum? Out with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288" name="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
it! In what part of the orchard have you hidden
it?"</p>
<p>"The money?" repeated the tramp with a stupid
look.</p>
<p>"Yes, the money! The money which you've
buried somewhere.... Oh, if we don't find it, your
goose is cooked!... We have witnesses, haven't
we?... All of you, friends, eh? And then the
gentleman...."</p>
<p>He turned, with the intention of addressing the
stranger, in the direction of the spring, which was
thirty or forty steps to the left. And he was quite
surprised not to see him washing his hands there:</p>
<p>"Has he gone?" he asked.</p>
<p>Some one answered:</p>
<p>"No, he lit a cigarette and went for a stroll in
the orchard."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right!" said the farmer. "He's
the sort to find the notes for us, just as he found
the man."</p>
<p>"Unless ..." said a voice.</p>
<p>"Unless what?" echoed the farmer. "What
do you mean? Have you something in your head?
Out with it, then! What is it?"</p>
<p>But he interrupted himself suddenly, seized with
a doubt; and there was a moment's silence. The
same idea dawned on all the country-folk. The
stranger's arrival at Héberville, the breakdown of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289" name="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
his motor, his manner of questioning the people at
the inn and of gaining admission to the farm: were
not all these part and parcel of a put-up job, the
trick of a cracksman who had learnt the story from
the papers and who had come to try his luck on the
spot?...</p>
<p>"Jolly smart of him!" said the inn-keeper.
"He must have taken the money from old Trainard's
pocket, before our eyes, while he was searching
him."</p>
<p>"Impossible!" spluttered Farmer Goussot. "He
would have been seen going out that way ... by
the house ... whereas he's strolling in the orchard."</p>
<p>Mother Goussot, all of a heap, suggested:</p>
<p>"The little door at the end, down there?..."</p>
<p>"The key never leaves me."</p>
<p>"But you showed it to him."</p>
<p>"Yes; and I took it back again.... Look, here
it is."</p>
<p>He clapped his hand to his pocket and uttered a
cry:</p>
<p>"Oh, dash it all, it's gone!... He's sneaked
it!..."</p>
<p>He at once rushed away, followed and escorted
by his sons and a number of the villagers.</p>
<p>When they were halfway down the orchard, they
heard the throb of a motor-car, obviously the one
belonging to the stranger, who had given orders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290" name="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to his chauffeur to wait for him at that lower
entrance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">When the Goussots reached the door, they saw
scrawled with a brick, on the worm-eaten panel, the
two words:</p>
<div class="center">"ARSÈNE LUPIN."</div>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>Stick to it as the angry Goussots might, they found
it impossible to prove that old Trainard had stolen
any money. Twenty persons had to bear witness
that, when all was said, nothing was discovered
on his person. He escaped with a few months'
imprisonment for the assault.</p>
<p>He did not regret them. As soon as he was
released, he was secretly informed that, every quarter,
on a given date, at a given hour, under a given
milestone on a given road, he would find three gold
louis.</p>
<p>To a man like old Trainard that means wealth.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">EDITH SWAN-NECK</h3>
<p>"Arsène Lupin, what's your real opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291" name="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Inspector Ganimard?"</p>
<p>"A very high one, my dear fellow."</p>
<p>"A very high one? Then why do you never
miss a chance of turning him into ridicule?"</p>
<p>"It's a bad habit; and I'm sorry for it. But
what can I say? It's the way of the world. Here's
a decent detective-chap, here's a whole pack of
decent men, who stand for law and order, who
protect us against the apaches, who risk their lives
for honest people like you and me; and we have
nothing to give them in return but flouts and gibes.
It's preposterous!"</p>
<p>"Bravo, Lupin! you're talking like a respectable
ratepayer!"</p>
<p>"What else am I? I may have peculiar views
about other people's property; but I assure you
that it's very different when my own's at stake.
By Jove, it doesn't do to lay hands on what belongs
to me! Then I'm out for blood! Aha! It's <i>my</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292" name="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
pocket, <i>my</i> money, <i>my</i> watch ... hands off! I
have the soul of a conservative, my dear fellow, the
instincts of a retired tradesman and a due respect
for every sort of tradition and authority. And
that is why Ganimard inspires me with no little
gratitude and esteem."</p>
<p>"But not much admiration?"</p>
<p>"Plenty of admiration too. Over and above the
dauntless courage which comes natural to all those
gentry at the Criminal Investigation Department,
Ganimard possesses very sterling qualities: decision,
insight and judgment. I have watched him at
work. He's somebody, when all's said. Do you
know the Edith Swan-neck story, as it was called?"</p>
<p>"I know as much as everybody knows."</p>
<p>"That means that you don't know it at all.
Well, that job was, I daresay, the one which I
thought out most cleverly, with the utmost care
and the utmost precaution, the one which I shrouded
in the greatest darkness and mystery, the one which
it took the biggest generalship to carry through.
It was a regular game of chess, played according to
strict scientific and mathematical rules. And yet
Ganimard ended by unravelling the knot. Thanks
to him, they know the truth to-day on the Quai
des Orfèvres. And it is a truth quite out of the
common, I assure you."</p>
<p>"May I hope to hear it?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293" name="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>"Certainly ... one of these days ... when I
have time.... But the Brunelli is dancing at
the Opera to-night; and, if she were not to see me
in my stall ...!"</p>
<p>I do not meet Lupin often. He confesses with
difficulty, when it suits him. It was only gradually,
by snatches, by odds and ends of confidences, that
I was able to obtain the different incidents and to
piece the story together in all its details.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>The main features are well known and I will
merely mention the facts.</p>
<p>Three years ago, when the train from Brest
arrived at Rennes, the door of one of the luggage
vans was found smashed in. This van had been
booked by Colonel Sparmiento, a rich Brazilian,
who was travelling with his wife in the same train.
It contained a complete set of tapestry-hangings.
The case in which one of these was packed had been
broken open and the tapestry had disappeared.</p>
<p>Colonel Sparmiento started proceedings against
the railway-company, claiming heavy damages, not
only for the stolen tapestry, but also for the loss
in value which the whole collection suffered in consequence
of the theft.</p>
<p>The police instituted inquiries. The company
offered a large reward. A fortnight later, a letter
which had come undone in the post was opened by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294" name="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the authorities and revealed the fact that the theft
had been carried out under the direction of Arsène
Lupin and that a package was to leave next day
for the United States. That same evening, the
tapestry was discovered in a trunk deposited in the
cloak-room at the Gare Saint-Lazare.</p>
<p>The scheme, therefore, had miscarried. Lupin felt
the disappointment so much that he vented his ill-humour
in a communication to Colonel Sparmiento,
ending with the following words, which were clear
enough for anybody:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"It was very considerate of me to take only
one. Next time, I shall take the twelve. <i>Verbum
sap.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40em;">"A. L."</p></div>
<p>Colonel Sparmiento had been living for some
months in a house standing at the end of a small
garden at the corner of the Rue de la Faisanderie and
the Rue Dufresnoy. He was a rather thick-set,
broad-shouldered man, with black hair and a swarthy
skin, always well and quietly dressed. He was
married to an extremely pretty but delicate Englishwoman,
who was much upset by the business of the
tapestries. From the first she implored her husband
to sell them for what they would fetch. The Colonel
had much too forcible and dogged a nature to yield
to what he had every right to describe as a woman's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295" name="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
fancies. He sold nothing, but he redoubled his
precautions and adopted every measure that was
likely to make an attempt at burglary impossible.</p>
<p>To begin with, so that he might confine his watch
to the garden-front, he walled up all the windows
on the ground-floor and the first floor overlooking
the Rue Dufresnoy. Next, he enlisted the services
of a firm which made a speciality of protecting
private houses against robberies. Every window
of the gallery in which the tapestries were hung
was fitted with invisible burglar alarms, the position
of which was known, to none but himself. These,
at the least touch, switched on all the electric
lights and set a whole system of bells and gongs
ringing.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the insurance companies to
which he applied refused to grant policies to any
considerable amount unless he consented to let
three men, supplied by the companies and paid by
himself, occupy the ground-floor of his house every
night. They selected for the purpose three ex-detectives,
tried and trustworthy men, all of whom
hated Lupin like poison. As for the servants, the
colonel had known them for years and was ready to
vouch for them.</p>
<p>After taking these steps and organizing the
defence of the house as though it were a fortress,
the colonel gave a great house-warming, a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296" name="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
private view, to which he invited the members of
both his clubs, as well as a certain number of ladies,
journalists, art-patrons and critics.</p>
<p>They felt, as they passed through the garden-gate,
much as if they were walking into a prison.
The three private detectives, posted at the foot of
the stairs, asked for each visitor's invitation card
and eyed him up and down suspiciously, making him
feel as though they were going to search his pockets
or take his finger-prints.</p>
<p>The colonel, who received his guests on the first
floor, made laughing apologies and seemed delighted
at the opportunity of explaining the arrangements
which he had invented to secure the safety of his
hangings. His wife stood by him, looking charmingly
young and pretty, fair-haired, pale and sinuous,
with a sad and gentle expression, the expression
of resignation often worn by those who are threatened
by fate.</p>
<p>When all the guests had come, the garden-gates
and the hall-doors were closed. Then everybody
filed into the middle gallery, which was reached
through two steel doors, while its windows, with
their huge shutters, were protected by iron bars.
This was where the twelve tapestries were kept.</p>
<p>They were matchless works of art and, taking
their inspiration from the famous Bayeux Tapestry,
attributed to Queen Matilda, they represented the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297" name="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
story of the Norman Conquest. They had been
ordered in the fourteenth century by the descendant
of a man-at-arms in William the Conqueror's
train; were executed by Jehan Gosset, a famous
Arras weaver; and were discovered, five hundred
years later, in an old Breton manor-house. On
hearing of this, the colonel had struck a bargain
for fifty thousand francs. They were worth ten
times the money.</p>
<p>But the finest of the twelve hangings composing
the set, the most uncommon because the subject
had not been treated by Queen Matilda, was the
one which Arsène Lupin had stolen and which
had been so fortunately recovered. It portrayed
Edith Swan-neck on the battlefield of Hastings,
seeking among the dead for the body of her sweetheart
Harold, last of the Saxon kings.</p>
<p>The guests were lost in enthusiasm over this
tapestry, over the unsophisticated beauty of the
design, over the faded colours, over the life-like
grouping of the figures and the pitiful sadness of
the scene. Poor Edith Swan-neck stood drooping
like an overweighted lily. Her white gown revealed
the lines of her languid figure. Her long,
tapering hands were outstretched in a gesture of
terror and entreaty. And nothing could be more
mournful than her profile, over which flickered
the most dejected and despairing of smiles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298" name="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>
<p>"A harrowing smile," remarked one of the
critics, to whom the others listened with deference.
"A very charming smile, besides; and it reminds
me, Colonel, of the smile of Mme. Sparmiento."</p>
<p>And seeing that the observation seemed to meet
with approval, he enlarged upon his idea:</p>
<p>"There are other points of resemblance that
struck me at once, such as the very graceful curve
of the neck and the delicacy of the hands ... and
also something about the figure, about the general
attitude...."</p>
<p>"What you say is so true," said the colonel,
"that I confess that it was this likeness that decided
me to buy the hangings. And there was
another reason, which was that, by a really curious
chance, my wife's name happens to be Edith. I
have called her Edith Swan-neck ever since."
And the colonel added, with a laugh, "I hope that
the coincidence will stop at this and that my dear
Edith will never have to go in search of her true-love's
body, like her prototype."</p>
<p>He laughed as he uttered these words, but his
laugh met with no echo; and we find the same
impression of awkward silence in all the accounts
of the evening that appeared during the next few
days. The people standing near him did not know
what to say. One of them tried to jest:</p>
<p>"Your name isn't Harold, Colonel?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299" name="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
<p>"No, thank you," he declared, with continued
merriment. "No, that's not my name; nor am I
in the least like the Saxon king."</p>
<p>All have since agreed in stating that, at that
moment, as the colonel finished speaking, the first
alarm rang from the windows—the right or the
middle window: opinions differ on this point—rang
short and shrill on a single note. The peal
of the alarm-bell was followed by an exclamation
of terror uttered by Mme. Sparmiento, who caught
hold of her husband's arm. He cried:</p>
<p>"What's the matter? What does this mean?"</p>
<p>The guests stood motionless, with their eyes
staring at the windows. The colonel repeated:</p>
<p>"What does it mean? I don't understand.
No one but myself knows where that bell is
fixed...."</p>
<p>And, at that moment—here again the evidence
is unanimous—at that moment came sudden, absolute
darkness, followed immediately by the maddening
din of all the bells and all the gongs, from
top to bottom of the house, in every room and at
every window.</p>
<p>For a few seconds, a stupid disorder, an insane
terror, reigned. The women screamed. The men
banged with their fists on the closed doors. They
hustled and fought. People fell to the floor and
were trampled under foot. It was like a panic-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300" name="Page_300">[300]</a></span>stricken
crowd, scared by threatening flames or by
a bursting shell. And, above the uproar, rose
the colonel's voice, shouting:</p>
<p>"Silence!... Don't move!... It's all right!...
The switch is over there, in the corner....
Wait a bit.... Here!"</p>
<p>He had pushed his way through his guests and
reached a corner of the gallery; and, all at once,
the electric light blazed up again, while the pandemonium
of bells stopped.</p>
<p>Then, in the sudden light, a strange sight met
the eyes. Two ladies had fainted. Mme. Sparmiento,
hanging to her husband's arm, with her
knees dragging on the floor, and livid in the face,
appeared half dead. The men, pale, with their
neckties awry, looked as if they had all been in
the wars.</p>
<p>"The tapestries are there!" cried some one.</p>
<p>There was a great surprise, as though the disappearance
of those hangings ought to have been
the natural result and the only plausible explanation
of the incident. But nothing had been moved.
A few valuable pictures, hanging on the walls,
were there still. And, though the same din had
reverberated all over the house, though all the
rooms had been thrown into darkness, the detectives
had seen no one entering or trying to
enter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301" name="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>"Besides," said the colonel, "it's only the windows
of the gallery that have alarms. Nobody
but myself understands how they work; and I had
not set them yet."</p>
<p>People laughed loudly at the way in which they
had been frightened, but they laughed without
conviction and in a more or less shamefaced fashion,
for each of them was keenly alive to the absurdity
of his conduct. And they had but one thought—to
get out of that house where, say what you would,
the atmosphere was one of agonizing anxiety.</p>
<p>Two journalists stayed behind, however; and the
colonel joined them, after attending to Edith and
handing her over to her maids. The three of
them, together with the detectives, made a search
that did not lead to the discovery of anything of
the least interest. Then the colonel sent for some
champagne; and the result was that it was not until
a late hour—to be exact, a quarter to three in
the morning—that the journalists took their leave,
the colonel retired to his quarters, and the detectives
withdrew to the room which had been set
aside for them on the ground-floor.</p>
<p>They took the watch by turns, a watch consisting,
in the first place, in keeping awake and,
next, in looking round the garden and visiting the
gallery at intervals.</p>
<p>These orders were scrupulously carried out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302" name="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
except between five and seven in the morning,
when sleep gained the mastery and the men ceased
to go their rounds. But it was broad daylight out
of doors. Besides, if there had been the least sound
of bells, would they not have woke up?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when one of them, at twenty minutes
past seven, opened the door of the gallery and
flung back the shutters, he saw that the twelve
tapestries were gone.</p>
<p>This man and the others were blamed afterward
for not giving the alarm at once and for starting
their own investigations before informing the
colonel and telephoning to the local commissary.
Yet this very excusable delay can hardly be said
to have hampered the action of the police. In
any case, the colonel was not told until half-past
eight. He was dressed and ready to go out. The
news did not seem to upset him beyond measure,
or, at least, he managed to control his emotion.
But the effort must have been too much for him,
for he suddenly dropped into a chair and, for some
moments, gave way to a regular fit of despair and
anguish, most painful to behold in a man of his
resolute appearance.</p>
<p>Recovering and mastering himself, he went to
the gallery, stared at the bare walls and then sat
down at a table and hastily scribbled a letter, which
he put into an envelope and sealed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303" name="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>
<p>"There," he said. "I'm in a hurry.... I
have an important engagement.... Here is a
letter for the commissary of police." And, seeing
the detectives' eyes upon him, he added, "I am
giving the commissary my views ... telling him
of a suspicion that occurs to me.... He must
follow it up.... I will do what I can...."</p>
<p>He left the house at a run, with excited gestures
which the detectives were subsequently to remember.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the commissary of police
arrived. He was handed the letter, which contained
the following words:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"I am at the end of my tether. The theft of
those tapestries completes the crash which I have
been trying to conceal for the past year. I bought
them as a speculation and was hoping to get a million
francs for them, thanks to the fuss that was
made about them. As it was, an American offered
me six hundred thousand. It meant my salvation.
This means utter destruction.</p>
<p>"I hope that my dear wife will forgive the sorrow
which I am bringing upon her. Her name
will be on my lips at the last moment."</p></div>
<p>Mme. Sparmiento was informed. She remained
aghast with horror, while inquiries were instituted
and attempts made to trace the colonel's movements.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304" name="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, a telephone-message
came from Ville d'Avray. A gang of railway-men
had found a man's body lying at the entrance to
a tunnel after a train had passed. The body was
hideously mutilated; the face had lost all resemblance
to anything human. There were no papers
in the pockets. But the description answered to
that of the colonel.</p>
<p>Mme. Sparmiento arrived at Ville d'Avray, by
motor-car, at seven o'clock in the evening. She
was taken to a room at the railway-station. When
the sheet that covered it was removed, Edith, Edith
Swan-neck, recognized her husband's body.</p>
<hr class="hr2"/>
<p>In these circumstances, Lupin did not receive his
usual good notices in the press:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Let him look to himself," jeered one leader-writer,
summing up the general opinion. "It would
not take many exploits of this kind for him to forfeit
the popularity which has not been grudged him
hitherto. We have no use for Lupin, except when
his rogueries are perpetrated at the expense of
shady company-promoters, foreign adventurers,
German barons, banks and financial companies.
And, above all, no murders! A burglar we can
put up with; but a murderer, no! If he is not
directly guilty, he is at least responsible for this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305" name="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
death. There is blood upon his hands; the arms
on his escutcheon are stained gules...."</p></div>
<p>The public anger and disgust were increased by
the pity which Edith's pale face aroused. The
guests of the night before gave their version of
what had happened, omitting none of the impressive
details; and a legend formed straightway around
the fair-haired Englishwoman, a legend that assumed
a really tragic character, owing to the popular story
of the swan-necked heroine.</p>
<p>And yet the public could not withhold its admiration
of the extraordinary skill with which the theft
had been effected. The police explained it, after
a fashion. The detectives had noticed from the
first and subsequently stated that one of the three
windows of the gallery was wide open. There
could be no doubt that Lupin and his confederates
had entered through this window. It seemed a
very plausible suggestion. Still, in that case, how
were they able, first, to climb the garden railings,
in coming and going, without being seen; secondly,
to cross the garden and put up a ladder on the flower-border,
without leaving the least trace behind;
thirdly, to open the shutters and the window, without
starting the bells and switching on the lights in
the house?</p>
<p>The police accused the three detectives of com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306" name="Page_306">[306]</a></span>plicity.
The magistrate in charge of the case examined
them at length, made minute inquiries
into their private lives and stated formally that they
were above all suspicion. As for the tapestries,
there seemed to be no hope that they would be
recovered.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Chief-inspector Ganimard
returned from India, where he had been hunting
for Lupin on the strength of a number of most
convincing proofs supplied by former confederates
of Lupin himself. Feeling that he had once
more been tricked by his everlasting adversary,
fully believing that Lupin had dispatched him on
this wild-goose chase so as to be rid of him during
the business of the tapestries, he asked for a fortnight's
leave of absence, called on Mme. Sparmiento
and promised to avenge her husband.</p>
<p>Edith had reached the point at which not even
the thought of vengeance relieves the sufferer's
pain. She had dismissed the three detectives on
the day of the funeral and engaged just one man
and an old cook-housekeeper to take the place of
the large staff of servants the sight of whom reminded
her too cruelly of the past. Not caring
what happened, she kept her room and left Ganimard
free to act as he pleased.</p>
<p>He took up his quarters on the ground-floor and
at once instituted a series of the most minute in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307" name="Page_307">[307]</a></span>vestigations.
He started the inquiry afresh, questioned
the people in the neighbourhood, studied
the distribution of the rooms and set each of the
burglar-alarms going thirty and forty times over.</p>
<p>At the end of the fortnight, he asked for an extension
of leave. The chief of the detective-service,
who was at that time M. Dudouis, came to
see him and found him perched on the top of a
ladder, in the gallery. That day, the chief-inspector
admitted that all his searches had proved
useless.</p>
<p>Two days later, however, M. Dudouis called
again and discovered Ganimard in a very thoughtful
frame of mind. A bundle of newspapers lay
spread in front of him. At last, in reply to
his superior's urgent questions, the chief-inspector
muttered:</p>
<p>"I know nothing, chief, absolutely nothing; but
there's a confounded notion worrying me.... Only
it seems so absurd.... And then it doesn't explain
things.... On the contrary, it confuses them
rather...."</p>
<p>"Then ...?"</p>
<p>"Then I implore you, chief, to have a little
patience ... to let me go my own way. But if
I telephone to you, some day or other, suddenly,
you must jump into a taxi, without losing a minute.
It will mean that I have discovered the secret."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308" name="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<p>Forty-eight hours passed. Then, one morning,
M. Dudouis received a telegram:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Going to Lille.</p>
<p style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 9em;">"Ganimard."</p></div>
<p>"What the dickens can he want to go to Lille
for?" wondered the chief-detective.</p>
<p>The day passed without news, followed by another
day. But M. Dudouis had every confidence in
Ganimard. He knew his man, knew that the old
detective was not one of those people who excite
themselves for nothing. When Ganimard "got a
move on him," it meant that he had sound reasons
for doing so.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, on the evening of that second
day, M. Dudouis was called to the telephone.</p>
<p>"Is that you, chief?"</p>
<p>"Is it Ganimard speaking?"</p>
<p>Cautious men both, they began by making
sure of each other's identity. As soon as his mind
was eased on this point, Ganimard continued, hurriedly:</p>
<p>"Ten men, chief, at once. And please come
yourself."</p>
<p>"Where are you?"</p>
<p>"In the house, on the ground-floor. But I will
wait for you just inside the garden-gate."</p>
<p>"I'll come at once. In a taxi, of course?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309" name="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, chief. Stop the taxi fifty yards from the
house. I'll let you in when you whistle."</p>
<p>Things took place as Ganimard had arranged.
Shortly after midnight, when all the lights were out
on the upper floors, he slipped into the street and
went to meet M. Dudouis. There was a hurried
consultation. The officers distributed themselves
as Ganimard ordered. Then the chief and the
chief-inspector walked back together, noiselessly
crossed the garden and closeted themselves with
every precaution:</p>
<p>"Well, what's it all about?" asked M. Dudouis.
"What does all this mean? Upon my word, we
look like a pair of conspirators!"</p>
<p>But Ganimard was not laughing. His chief had
never seen him in such a state of perturbation, nor
heard him speak in a voice denoting such excitement:</p>
<p>"Any news, Ganimard?"</p>
<p>"Yes, chief, and ... this time ...! But I
can hardly believe it myself.... And yet I'm not
mistaken: I know the real truth.... It may be as
unlikely as you please, but it is the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth."</p>
<p>He wiped away the drops of perspiration that
trickled down his forehead and, after a further
question from M. Dudouis, pulled himself together,
swallowed a glass of water and began:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310" name="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>
<p>"Lupin has often got the better of me...."</p>
<p>"Look here, Ganimard," said M. Dudouis, interrupting
him. "Why can't you come straight
to the point? Tell me, in two words, what's happened."</p>
<p>"No, chief," retorted the chief-inspector, "it is
essential that you should know the different stages
which I have passed through. Excuse me, but
I consider it indispensable." And he repeated:
"I was saying, chief, that Lupin has often got the
better of me and led me many a dance. But, in this
contest in which I have always come out worst ...
so far ... I have at least gained experience of his
manner of play and learnt to know his tactics.
Now, in the matter of the tapestries, it occurred to
me almost from the start to set myself two problems.
In the first place, Lupin, who never makes a move
without knowing what he is after, was obviously
aware that Colonel Sparmiento had come to the end
of his money and that the loss of the tapestries
might drive him to suicide. Nevertheless, Lupin,
who hates the very thought of bloodshed, stole the
tapestries."</p>
<p>"There was the inducement," said M. Dudouis,
"of the five or six hundred thousand francs which
they are worth."</p>
<p>"No, chief, I tell you once more, whatever the
occasion might be, Lupin would not take life, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311" name="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
be the cause of another person's death, for anything
in this world, for millions and millions. That's the
first point. In the second place, what was the
object of all that disturbance, in the evening, during
the house-warming party? Obviously, don't you
think, to surround the business with an atmosphere
of anxiety and terror, in the shortest possible time,
and also to divert suspicion from the truth, which,
otherwise, might easily have been suspected?...
You seem not to understand, chief?"</p>
<p>"Upon my word, I do not!"</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact," said Ganimard, "as a
matter of fact, it is not particularly plain. And
I myself, when I put the problem before my mind
in those same words, did not understand it very
clearly.... And yet I felt that I was on the right
track.... Yes, there was no doubt about it that
Lupin wanted to divert suspicions ... to divert
them to himself, Lupin, mark you ... so that the
real person who was working the business might
remain unknown...."</p>
<p>"A confederate," suggested M. Dudouis. "A
confederate, moving among the visitors, who set
the alarms going ... and who managed to hide
in the house after the party had broken up."</p>
<p>"You're getting warm, chief, you're getting
warm! It is certain that the tapestries, as they
cannot have been stolen by any one making his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312" name="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
way surreptitiously into the house, were stolen
by somebody who remained in the house; and it
is equally certain that, by taking the list of the
people invited and inquiring into the antecedents
of each of them, one might...."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well, chief, there's a 'but,' namely, that the
three detectives had this list in their hands when
the guests arrived and that they still had it when
the guests left. Now sixty-three came in and sixty-three
went away. So you see...."</p>
<p>"Then do you suppose a servant?..."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"The detectives?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But, still ... but, still," said the chief, impatiently,
"if the robbery was committed from
the inside...."</p>
<p>"That is beyond dispute," declared the inspector,
whose excitement seemed to be nearing fever-point.
"There is no question about it. All my
investigations led to the same certainty. And
my conviction gradually became so positive that
I ended, one day, by drawing up this startling axiom:
in theory and in fact, the robbery can only
have been committed with the assistance of an
accomplice staying in the house. Whereas there
was no accomplice!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313" name="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>
<p>"That's absurd," said Dudouis.</p>
<p>"Quite absurd," said Ganimard. "But, at the
very moment when I uttered that absurd sentence,
the truth flashed upon me."</p>
<p>"Eh?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a very dim, very incomplete, but still
sufficient truth! With that clue to guide me,
I was bound to find the way. Do you follow me,
chief?"</p>
<p>M. Dudouis sat silent. The same phenomenon
that had taken place in Ganimard was evidently
taking place in him. He muttered:</p>
<p>"If it's not one of the guests, nor the servants,
nor the private detectives, then there's no one
left...."</p>
<p>"Yes, chief, there's one left...."</p>
<p>M. Dudouis started as though he had received
a shock; and, in a voice that betrayed his excitement:</p>
<p>"But, look here, that's preposterous."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Come, think for yourself!"</p>
<p>"Go on, chief: say what's in your mind."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Go on, chief."</p>
<p>"It's impossible! How can Sparmiento have been
Lupin's accomplice?"</p>
<p>Ganimard gave a little chuckle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314" name="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
<p>"Exactly, Arsène Lupin's accomplice!... That
explains everything. During the night, while the
three detectives were downstairs watching, or
sleeping rather, for Colonel Sparmiento had given
them champagne to drink and perhaps doctored
it beforehand, the said colonel took down the hangings
and passed them out through the window
of his bedroom. The room is on the second floor
and looks out on another street, which was not
watched, because the lower windows are walled up."</p>
<p>M. Dudouis reflected and then shrugged his
shoulders:</p>
<p>"It's preposterous!" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why? Because, if the colonel had been Arsène
Lupin's accomplice, he would not have committed
suicide after achieving his success."</p>
<p>"Who says that he committed suicide?"</p>
<p>"Why, he was found dead on the line!"</p>
<p>"I told you, there is no such thing as death with
Lupin."</p>
<p>"Still, this was genuine enough. Besides, Mme.
Sparmiento identified the body."</p>
<p>"I thought you would say that, chief. The
argument worried me too. There was I, all of
a sudden, with three people in front of me instead
of one: first, Arsène Lupin, cracksman; secondly,
Colonel Sparmiento, his accomplice; thirdly, a dead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315" name="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
man. Spare us! It was too much of a good
thing!"</p>
<p>Ganimard took a bundle of newspapers, untied
it and handed one of them to Mr. Dudouis:</p>
<p>"You remember, chief, last time you were here,
I was looking through the papers.... I wanted to
see if something had not happened, at that period,
that might bear upon the case and confirm my
supposition. Please read this paragraph."</p>
<p>M. Dudouis took the paper and read aloud:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"Our Lille correspondent informs us that a
curious incident has occurred in that town. A
corpse has disappeared from the local morgue,
the corpse of a man unknown who threw himself
under the wheels of a steam tram-car on the day
before. No one is able to suggest a reason for
this disappearance."</p></div>
<p>M. Dudouis sat thinking and then asked:</p>
<p>"So ... you believe ...?"</p>
<p>"I have just come from Lille," replied Ganimard,
"and my inquiries leave not a doubt in my mind.
The corpse was removed on the same night on
which Colonel Sparmiento gave his house-warming.
It was taken straight to Ville d'Avray by motor-car;
and the car remained near the railway-line
until the evening."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316" name="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<p>"Near the tunnel, therefore," said M. Dudouis.</p>
<p>"Next to it, chief."</p>
<p>"So that the body which was found is merely
that body, dressed in Colonel Sparmiento's clothes."</p>
<p>"Precisely, chief."</p>
<p>"Then Colonel Sparmiento is not dead?"</p>
<p>"No more dead than you or I, chief."</p>
<p>"But then why all these complications? Why
the theft of one tapestry, followed by its recovery,
followed by the theft of the twelve? Why that
house-warming? Why that disturbance? Why
everything? Your story won't hold water, Ganimard."</p>
<p>"Only because you, chief, like myself, have
stopped halfway; because, strange as this story
already sounds, we must go still farther, very much
farther, in the direction of the improbable and the
astounding. And why not, after all? Remember
that we are dealing with Arsène Lupin. With
him, is it not always just the improbable and the
astounding that we must look for? Must we not
always go straight for the maddest suppositions?
And, when I say the maddest, I am using the wrong
word. On the contrary, the whole thing is wonderfully
logical and so simple that a child could
understand it. Confederates only betray you. Why
employ confederates, when it is so easy and so
natural to act for yourself, by yourself, with your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317" name="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
own hands and by the means within your own
reach?"</p>
<p>"What are you saying?... What are you
saying?... What are you saying?" cried M.
Dudouis, in a sort of sing-song voice and a tone
of bewilderment that increased with each separate
exclamation.</p>
<p>Ganimard gave a fresh chuckle.</p>
<p>"Takes your breath away, chief, doesn't it?
So it did mine, on the day when you came to see me
here and when the notion was beginning to grow
upon me. I was flabbergasted with astonishment.
And yet I've had experience of my customer. I
know what he's capable of.... But this, no, this
was really a bit too stiff!"</p>
<p>"It's impossible! It's impossible!" said M.
Dudouis, in a low voice.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, chief, it's quite possible and
quite logical and quite normal. It's the threefold
incarnation of one and the same individual. A
schoolboy would solve the problem in a minute,
by a simple process of elimination. Take away the
dead man: there remains Sparmiento and Lupin.
Take away Sparmiento...."</p>
<p>"There remains Lupin," muttered the chief-detective.</p>
<p>"Yes, chief, Lupin simply, Lupin in five letters
and two syllables, Lupin taken out of his Brazilian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318" name="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
skin, Lupin revived from the dead, Lupin translated,
for the past six months, into Colonel Sparmiento,
travelling in Brittany, hearing of the discovery
of the twelve tapestries, buying them,
planning the theft of the best of them, so as to draw
attention to himself, Lupin, and divert it from himself,
Sparmiento. Next, he brings about, in full
view of the gaping public, a noisy contest between
Lupin and Sparmiento or Sparmiento and Lupin,
plots and gives the house-warming party, terrifies
his guests and, when everything is ready, arranges
for Lupin to steal Sparmiento's tapestries and for
Sparmiento, Lupin's victim, to disappear from sight
and die unsuspected, unsuspectable, regretted by
his friends, pitied by the public and leaving behind
him, to pocket the profits of the swindle...."</p>
<p>Ganimard stopped, looked the chief in the eyes
and, in a voice that emphasized the importance
of his words, concluded:</p>
<p>"Leaving behind him a disconsolate widow."</p>
<p>"Mme. Sparmiento! You really believe....?</p>
<p>"Hang it all!" said the chief-inspector. "People
don't work up a whole business of this sort, without
seeing something ahead of them ... solid profits."</p>
<p>"But the profits, it seems to me, lie in the sale of
the tapestries which Lupin will effect in America or
elsewhere."</p>
<p>"First of all, yes. But Colonel Sparmiento could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319" name="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
effect that sale just as well. And even better. So
there's something more."</p>
<p>"Something more?"</p>
<p>"Come, chief, you're forgetting that Colonel
Sparmiento has been the victim of an important
robbery and that, though he may be dead, at least
his widow remains. So it's his widow who will get
the money."</p>
<p>"What money?"</p>
<p>"What money? Why, the money due to her!
The insurance-money, of course!"</p>
<p>M. Dudouis was staggered. The whole business
suddenly became clear to him, with its real meaning.
He muttered:</p>
<p>"That's true!... That's true!... The
colonel had insured his tapestries...."</p>
<p>"Rather! And for no trifle either."</p>
<p>"For how much?"</p>
<p>"Eight hundred thousand francs."</p>
<p>"Eight hundred thousand?"</p>
<p>"Just so. In five different companies."</p>
<p>"And has Mme. Sparmiento had the money?"</p>
<p>"She got a hundred and fifty thousand francs
yesterday and two hundred thousand to-day, while
I was away. The remaining payments are to be
made in the course of this week."</p>
<p>"But this is terrible! You ought to have...."</p>
<p>"What, chief? To begin with, they took ad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320" name="Page_320">[320]</a></span>vantage
of my absence to settle up accounts with
the companies. I only heard about it on my return
when I ran up against an insurance-manager whom
I happen to know and took the opportunity of
drawing him out."</p>
<p>The chief-detective was silent for some time,
not knowing what to say. Then he mumbled:</p>
<p>"What a fellow, though!"</p>
<p>Ganimard nodded his head:</p>
<p>"Yes, chief, a blackguard, but, I can't help saying,
a devil of a clever fellow. For his plan to succeed,
he must have managed in such a way that, for four
or five weeks, no one could express or even conceive
the least suspicion of the part played by Colonel
Sparmiento. All the indignation and all the inquiries
had to be concentrated upon Lupin alone.
In the last resort, people had to find themselves
faced simply with a mournful, pitiful, penniless
widow, poor Edith Swan-neck, a beautiful and
legendary vision, a creature so pathetic that the
gentlemen of the insurance-companies were almost
glad to place something in her hands to relieve her
poverty and her grief. That's what was wanted
and that's what happened."</p>
<p>The two men were close together and did not
take their eyes from each other's faces.</p>
<p>The chief asked:</p>
<p>"Who is that woman?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321" name="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sonia Kritchnoff."</p>
<p>"Sonia Kritchnoff?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the Russian girl whom I arrested last year
at the time of the theft of the coronet, and whom
Lupin helped to escape."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a></p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I was put off the scent, like everybody
else, by Lupin's machinations, and had paid
no particular attention to her. But, when I knew
the part which she was playing, I remembered.
She is certainly Sonia, metamorphosed into an
Englishwoman; Sonia, the most innocent-looking
and the trickiest of actresses; Sonia, who would not
hesitate to face death for love of Lupin."</p>
<p>"A good capture, Ganimard," said M. Dudouis,
approvingly.</p>
<p>"I've something better still for you, chief!"</p>
<p>"Really? What?"</p>
<p>"Lupin's old foster-mother."</p>
<p>"Victoire?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></p>
<p>"She has been here since Mme. Sparmiento began
playing the widow; she's the cook."</p>
<p>"Oho!" said M. Dudouis. "My congratulations,
Ganimard!"</p>
<p>"I've something for you, chief, that's even better
than that!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322" name="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<p>M. Dudouis gave a start. The inspector's hand
clutched his and was shaking with excitement.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Ganimard?"</p>
<p>"Do you think, chief, that I would have brought
you here, at this late hour, if I had had nothing more
attractive to offer you than Sonia and Victoire?
Pah! They'd have kept!"</p>
<p>"You mean to say ...?" whispered M. Dudouis,
at last, understanding the chief-inspector's agitation.</p>
<p>"You've guessed it, chief!"</p>
<p>"Is he here?"</p>
<p>"He's here."</p>
<p>"In hiding?"</p>
<p>"Not a bit of it. Simply in disguise. He's the
man-servant."</p>
<p>This time, M. Dudouis did not utter a word nor
make a gesture. Lupin's audacity confounded him.</p>
<p>Ganimard chuckled.</p>
<p>"It's no longer a threefold, but a fourfold incarnation.
Edith Swan-neck might have blundered.
The master's presence was necessary; and he had
the cheek to return. For three weeks, he has been
beside me during my inquiry, calmly following the
progress made."</p>
<p>"Did you recognize him?"</p>
<p>"One doesn't recognize him. He has a knack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323" name="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of making-up his face and altering the proportions
of his body so as to prevent any one from knowing
him. Besides, I was miles from suspecting.... But,
this evening, as I was watching Sonia in the
shadow of the stairs, I heard Victoire speak to the
man-servant and call him, 'Dearie.' A light
flashed in upon me. 'Dearie!' That was what
she always used to call him. And I knew where
I was."</p>
<p>M. Dudouis seemed flustered, in his turn, by the
presence of the enemy, so often pursued and always
so intangible:</p>
<p>"We've got him, this time," he said, between his
teeth. "We've got him; and he can't escape us."</p>
<p>"No, chief, he can't: neither he nor the two
women."</p>
<p>"Where are they?"</p>
<p>"Sonia and Victoire are on the second floor; Lupin
is on the third."</p>
<p>M. Dudouis suddenly became anxious:</p>
<p>"Why, it was through the windows of one of
those floors that the tapestries were passed when
they disappeared!"</p>
<p>"That's so, chief."</p>
<p>"In that case, Lupin can get away too. The
windows look out on the Rue Dufresnoy."</p>
<p>"Of course they do, chief; but I have taken my
precautions. The moment you arrived, I sent four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324" name="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of our men to keep watch under the windows in the
Rue Dufresnoy. They have strict instructions to
shoot, if any one appears at the windows and looks
like coming down. Blank cartridges for the first
shot, ball-cartridges for the next."</p>
<p>"Good, Ganimard! You have thought of everything.
We'll wait here; and, immediately after
sunrise...."</p>
<p>"Wait, chief? Stand on ceremony with that
rascal? Bother about rules and regulations, legal
hours and all that rot? And suppose he's not
quite so polite to us and gives us the slip meanwhile?
Suppose he plays us one of his Lupin
tricks? No, no, we must have no nonsense!
We've got him: let's collar him; and that without
delay!"</p>
<p>And Ganimard, all a-quiver with indignant impatience,
went out, walked across the garden and
presently returned with half-a-dozen men:</p>
<p>"It's all right, chief. I've told them, in the
Rue Dufresnoy, to get their revolvers out and aim
at the windows. Come along."</p>
<p>These alarums and excursions had not been
effected without a certain amount of noise, which
was bound to be heard by the inhabitants of the
house. M. Dudouis felt that his hand was forced.
He made up his mind to act:</p>
<p>"Come on, then," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325" name="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>
<p>The thing did not take long. The eight of them,
Browning pistols in hand, went up the stairs without
overmuch precaution, eager to surprise Lupin before
he had time to organize his defences.</p>
<p>"Open the door!" roared Ganimard, rushing
at the door of Mme. Sparmiento's bedroom.</p>
<p>A policeman smashed it in with his shoulder.</p>
<p>There was no one in the room; and no one in
Victoire's bedroom either.</p>
<p>"They're all upstairs!" shouted Ganimard.
"They've gone up to Lupin in his attic. Be careful
now!"</p>
<p>All the eight ran up the third flight of stairs.
To his great astonishment, Ganimard found the
door of the attic open and the attic empty. And
the other rooms were empty too.</p>
<p>"Blast them!" he cursed. "What's become
of them?"</p>
<p>But the chief called him. M. Dudouis, who
had gone down again to the second floor, noticed
that one of the windows was not latched, but just
pushed to:</p>
<p>"There," he said, to Ganimard, "that's the
road they took, the road of the tapestries. I told
you as much: the Rue Dufresnoy...."</p>
<p>"But our men would have fired on them," protested
Ganimard, grinding his teeth with rage.
"The street's guarded."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326" name="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>
<p>"They must have gone before the street was
guarded."</p>
<p>"They were all three of them in their rooms
when I rang you up, chief!"</p>
<p>"They must have gone while you were waiting
for me in the garden."</p>
<p>"But why? Why? There was no reason why
they should go to-day rather than to-morrow, or
the next day, or next week, for that matter, when
they had pocketed all the insurance-money!"</p>
<p>Yes, there was a reason; and Ganimard knew
it when he saw, on the table, a letter addressed to
himself and opened it and read it. The letter
was worded in the style of the testimonials which
we hand to people in our service who have given
satisfaction:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><p>"I, the undersigned, Arsène Lupin, gentleman-burglar,
ex-colonel, ex-man-of-all-work, ex-corpse,
hereby certify that the person of the name of Ganimard
gave proof of the most remarkable qualities
during his stay in this house. He was
exemplary in his behaviour, thoroughly devoted
and attentive; and, unaided by the least clue, he
foiled a part of my plans and saved the insurance-companies
four hundred and fifty thousand francs.
I congratulate him; and I am quite willing to overlook
his blunder in not anticipating that the down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327" name="Page_327">[327]</a></span>stairs
telephone communicates with the telephone
in Sonia Kritchnoff's bedroom and that, when
telephoning to Mr. Chief-detective, he was at
the same time telephoning to me to clear out as
fast as I could. It was a pardonable slip, which
must not be allowed to dim the glamour of his services
nor to detract from the merits of his victory.</p>
<p>"Having said this, I beg him to accept the
homage of my admiration and of my sincere
friendship.</p>
<p style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 35em; margin-top: 1em;">"Arsène Lupin"</p></div>
